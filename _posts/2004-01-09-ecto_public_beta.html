<p>The current version is <strong>very</strong> stable, and offers all of Kung-Log's features and more. It is setup in a matter of seconds, and the new user interface is strait-forward for anyone who's used Kung Log or MovableType's post form.</p>
<p>I'm using it with <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">MovableType</a> and <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> without any problem. </p>
