<p>While catching up with my RSS feeds, I discovered that <a href="http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2012/03/remebering-moebius.html">Jean Giraud past away today</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Giraud" title="Jean Giraud" class="sidelist">Jean Giraud</a> was also known under the pseudo <strong>Moebius</strong>.</p>

<p>My teens (and much later) were spent reading <a class="sidelist" title="Hara-Kiri" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hara-Kiri_(magazine)">Hara-Kiri</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Métal_Hurlant" class="sidelist" title="Métal Hurlant">Métal Hurlant</a>, and following the adventures of <a class="sidelist" title="Blueberry" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueberry_(comics)">Blueberry</a>, («Le cheval de fer» was the first I read) and later those of John DiFool in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incal" title="L'Incal" class="sidelist">The Incal</a>.</p>

<p>I was impressed (I still am) by his drawing style. He drew etchings, white and black illustrations, worked in colour of the <em>ligne claire</em> genre, and water colours. His simple style still reaches deep into my memory cells and triggers intense emotions. He is a big part of my personal comics culture.</p>

<p>I'll be reading «Fort Navaro» and all the following episodes over the next days.</p>

<p>My heart goes out to his family and friends.</p>
