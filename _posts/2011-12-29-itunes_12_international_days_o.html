<p>A quick tip for those who have installed <a class="sidelist" href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/itunes-12-days-of-christmas/id479672983?mt=8" title="12 Days of Christmas App">iTunes - 12 Days of Christmas</a> app and are experiencing unavailable song/book/show issues on your iOS devices (iPod, iPad, iPhone).</p>
<p>You need to make sure your <abbr title="Internationalisation">i18n</abbr> settings are correct: Settings > General > International > Region Format <strong>must</strong> match your iTunes Store.</p>
<p>I am located in Switzerland and run my iOS devices in English, with the UK region format, but buy from the Swiss iTunes Store. The app will fail if I don't set my <strong>Region Format</strong> to French > Switzerland.</p>
<p>From what I've read on the Internets, this applies to people in other countries who have configured their devices differently from the locale of their current iTunes Store.</p>
<p>As I've previously written, <a class="sidelist "href="/tag/l10n" title="Apple's localisation issues">Apple is poor at managing localisation</a> (l10n).</p>
