<blockquote><strong>This is your life</strong>. Do what you want and do it often.<br/>
If you don't like something, change it. <br/>
If you don't like your job, quit.<br/>
If you don't have enough time, stop watching TV.<br/>
If you are looking for the love of your life, stop; they will be waiting for you when you start doing things you love.<br/>
Stop over-analysing, life is simple.<br/>
<strong>All emotions are beautiful</strong>.<br/>
When you eat, appreciate every last bite.<br/>
<strong>Life is simple</strong>.<br/>
Open your heart, mind and arms to new things and people, we are united in our differences.<br/>
Ask the next person you see what their passion is and share your inspiring dream with them.<br/>
<strong>Travel often</strong>; getting lost will help you find yourself.<br/>
Some opportunities only come once, seize them.<br/>
Life is about the people you meet and the things you create with them, so go out and start creating.<br/>
<strong>Life is short</strong>, live your dream and share your passion.<br/>
