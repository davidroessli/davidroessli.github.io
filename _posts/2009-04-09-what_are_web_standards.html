<p>An interview of Jeffrey Zeldman on web standards by Big Think. Found in <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.zeldman.com/2009/04/08/what-are-web-standards/" title="What are web standards? - zeldman.com">the daily report</a> on zeldman.com.</p>

<p>Just under ten minutes with the man without whom the web standards would probably not have taken off. Author of “<a class="sidelist" href="http://books.google.com/books?as_isbn=0735712018" title="Designing With Web Standards">Designing With Web Standards</a>” which was probably the most enlightening book I have ever read in my field.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to meet him at the first edition of <a class="sidelist" href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia/" title="@media conferences">@media 2005</a> where he gave the opening talk. That event was awesome, just as those that followed, but the first one really lifted me off the ground. If you are into web design conferences don't miss <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2009/" title="@media 2009 - the fith edition">this year's edition end of June</a>.</p>
