<p>Yahoo! seems to be launching a Twitter/Tumblr service call <a href="http://meme.yahoo.com/home/" title="Meme from Yahoo!">Meme</a>.</p>

<p>Yahoo! has been very quiet about this and seems to be experimenting it in Portuguese and Spanish first.</p>

<blockquote>Found the new Internet hit? Send it to your Meme.
Everyone will know you found it first. Coming soon.</blockquote>

<p>At first sight (and without an account), it looks like a pale imitation of Twitter (post 100 characters messages with a repost and comment features). People can follow other peoples' feeds. It reminds me of Tumblr in the way you can post text, images, video, audio or a mix of all.</p>

<p>I'll give it a try when I receive my invitation.</p>
