<p>It all start with a heartbeat. Loud. Deep. Intense.</p>
<p>Then <a class="sidelist" title="Kaori Ito" href="http://www.kaoriito.com/">Kaori Ito</a> slowly disappears as eaten up by the curtain behind her, only to reappear in your dreams, or nightmares.</p>
<p>The sound of her body, her fingers, her nails, her feet against the cords and the setup gives texture to her mouvements. The loud repetitive soundtrack beats it into your consciousness.</p>
<p>She moves, falls, stops and climbs with and against all odds gravitates upside down and back again, grinding her way into your soul and burning your memories.</p>
<p>It was an amazing show crafted by <a class="sidelist" title="Aurélien Bory" href="http://www.cie111.com/fr/compagnie-111/equipe/biographies/36-aurelien-bory">Aurélien Bory</a> in which Kaori Ito becomes part of an intimate landscape, unfolding before your eyes, and resonating in your heart. <strong>A must see.</strong></p>
<p class="update"><a class="sidelist" title="Plexus on kaoriito.com" href="http://www.kaoriito.com/en/index.php?/projets/plexus/">Plexus</a> is showing at the <a class="sidelist" title="Plexus at the ADC" href="http://www.adc-geneve.ch/plexus.html">ADC</a> until 9 December 2014.</p>
