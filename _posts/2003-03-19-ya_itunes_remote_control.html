<br />
There's been a lot of talk around iTunes since the <a href="http://www.idees.ch/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=2&search=icommune">iCommune</a> project was closed down, and <a href="http://www.macinblog.com/mac/archives/000233.php">Earphoria</a> appeared. Well, I must admit that I overlooked iHam which is a great little app to control your iTunes jukebox. The application has been salvaged by <a href="http://www.swssoftware.com/">SearchWare Solutions</a> which now offers a <a href="http://www.swssoftware.com/products/ihamwin.html">Windows version</a> in beta.<br />
<br />
I must admit that it works like a charm. I prefer it to the other remote control solutions currently available. Give it a try.</p>
<p><b>2003-03-21 update</b>: <a href="http://www.swssoftware.com/products/iham.html">version 2 </a>has just been released </p>
