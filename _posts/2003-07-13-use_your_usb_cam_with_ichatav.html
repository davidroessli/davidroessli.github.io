<p>iChatAV beta doesn't offer support for USB cams (yet - although in some conditions, they seem to function). <a href="http://www.ecamm.com/mac/ichatusbcam/">iChatUSBCam</a> fills in this gap by activating any cam that uses<a href="http://ioxperts.com/usbwebcam.html"> IOXpert's USB webcam</a> driver.<br />
<br />iChatUSBCam is an Application Enhancer module that requires Unsanity's <a href="http://www.unsanity.com/haxies/ape/">Application Enhancer</a> to be installed beforehand.<br /><br />I'll be giving this app a try later this week and will update this post accordingly - but don't expect anything in depth as I received my iSight on Friday ;).</p>
