<p>Some #days can be easier than others.</p>
<p>I have this natural tendency to try and help when sometimes it's best to stay at bay. The worst is when you discover that by trying to help, you become part of the problem.</p>
<p>It take some resilience to accept and let go. Especially when you're of the St Bernard type.</p>
