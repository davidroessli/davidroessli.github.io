<p>Yes, it's been another one of these days when hours just melt into each other, and you get this growing impression that for each step forward, you go back two. </p>
<p>But it's not really true. I think the frustration builds up from the fact that unplanned events come into view, and lead you astray from what you originally wanted to do - or planned to do.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/davo39/img/todo040107.png" height="120" width="120" border="0" align="left" alt="[ last year's to dos ]" style="margin-right:15px;" />This happens to me on the web sometimes. Back into my academic environnement, things prop up from nowhere, people come with their problems, crashes and bugs - which often lead to other problems and bugs - and time just melts away. Suddently, it's lunchtime, and you've barely read/managed your e-mail.</p>
<p>Suddenly it's dark, and you've barely began what you planned - or wished - to do.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's just a perverse form of lack of motivation for the single task you're trying to complete, before tackling all those of last year's to do list ?</p>
