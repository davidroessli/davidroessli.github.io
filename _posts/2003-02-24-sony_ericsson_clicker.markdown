Okay, this is a really geeky one to start the week with.. but I love it (you know me). Imagine using your Sony Ericssoncell phone to drive a Keynote presentation, remote control iTunes, DVD Player or any scriptable application on your Mac via Bluetooth..

Maybe the coolest touch is the ability to setup the proximity sensor: choose an action to execute when you leave or reenter the Bluetooth radius. iTunes or DVD Player pauses, your Mac welcomes you back, locks your screen, etc.
