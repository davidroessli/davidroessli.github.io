<p>You've lead us to the top. Just like thirteen years ago, when me feet didn't touch the ground for a week, I'm over the moon.</p>
<p>I'm proud to know you, proud to be your dad, proud to see you grow into an independant young man, generous, conscious and sensitive of the world around you.</p>
<p>Thank you for being you and for shining into our lives.</p>
<p>Happy birthday Mathias - love // dad</p>
