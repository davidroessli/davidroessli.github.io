<p>A quick CSS tip before I forget:</p>
<p>I've been wrecking my brains this afternoon  to figure out why a border-image stopped displaying properly in the lastest version of Firefox (15.0.1) although it showed up properly in previous versions.</p>
<p>The CSS properties were:</p>

<pre>
div.mod-registration {
  border-width: 164px 51px 98px 90px;
  -moz-border-image: url(../img/torn-paper02.png) 164 51 98 90 stretch;
  -webkit-border-image: url(../img/torn-paper02.png) 164 51 98 90 stretch;
  -o-border-image: url(../img/torn-paper02.png) 164 51 98 90 stretch;
  border-image: url(../img/torn-paper02.png) 164 51 98 90 stretch;
}
</pre>

<p>But nothing was displayed, as if border-image wasn't supported.</p>
<p>The trick was to specify a border-style:</p>

<pre>
border-style: solid; 
</pre>

<p>Now everything is back to normal.</p>
