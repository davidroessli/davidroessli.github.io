It occured at 16:55 CET when I started to experiment with .htaccess support on TP, and uploaded a configuration file which generated a 500 error.</p>
<p>I opened a support ticket, and hopefully the problem shall be solved very soon thanks to SixApart's online help.</p>
<p>Oh well, don't look at me like that - someone had to try, no?</p>

Hi David,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the report. The system stops you from creating an htaccess file in your template set, but not if you upload it.<br />
<br />
We're working on the file manager for this and it's high priority to add to the system.<br />
<br />
Ben can delete the extra file for you, I'll mark this for him to take a look. Thanks, and sorry for the trouble.<br />
<br />
Thank you,
