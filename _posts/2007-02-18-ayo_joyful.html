<div class="pix right"><a class="sidelist" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=159611417&s=143459" title="Ayo | Joyful"><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/logs/assets/img/ayo_joyful.jpg" alt="Ayo | Joyful" title="Ayo | Joyful" /></a></div>

<p>I discovered <a class="sidelist" href="http://http://ayomusic.artistes.universalmusic.fr/" title="Ayo">Ayo</a> (<em>Joy</em> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language" title="Yoruba language on Wikipedia">Yoruba</a>) quite by chance just before leaving for <a href="https://www.davidroessli.com/logs/2007/02/unplugged_in_leysin_1/" title="Unplugged in Leysin">Leysin</a> last week. I was following a trail of <em>"you bought this - see what others bought"</em> on the <abbr title="Apple's iTunes Store">iTS</abbr> when I fell on Ayo's first album: <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=159611417&s=143459" title="Ayo | Joyful">Joyful</a>. After listening to a few extracts, I was seduced.</p>

<p>My first impression was confirmed over time. I was taken in by her delicate melodies which constantly reminded me of a mix of <a class="sidelist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesária_Évora" title="Cesária Évora on Wikipedia">Cesária Évora</a>, <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.corinnebaileyrae.net/" title="Corinne Bailey Rae">Corinne Bailey Rae</a> or <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.norahjones.com/" title="Norah Jones">Norah Jones</a>. Her voice is warm, powerful and enticing, just as the sound of her guitar. The genre is difficult to categorise: somewhat a cross between reggae, soul and jazz. Enchanting.</p>

<p>This album was released last summer, and it took me over 6 months to discover it. Don't wait as long.</p>
