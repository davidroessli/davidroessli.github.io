title: Address Book Map function in Europe
date: '2004-03-04 09:49:27 +0100'
excerpt: |-
  <p>The default map function of the Address Book is a cool trick, but isn't very useful to users living out of the USA. But there's a new plugin on the block: <a href="http://www.jeangabi.com/">Mappy Address Book</a></p>
  <p>A neat Address Book plugin which enables the Address Book to hook into the online <a href="htttp://www.mappy.com/">Mappy</a> services. You can map an address or route it. Works like a charm.</p>
