<p class="update">2017-09-26 : this site has been discontinued. Joel Stephens of Comparitech has put together a <a class="sidelist" title="PrivacyFix and ReclaimPrivacy are no more, but you can still protect yourself" href="http://comparitech.net/reclaimprivacy">guide</a> which looks at securing Facebook as well as other accounts and apps. It deals with those who used Reclaim Privacy and AVG's Privacy Fix which was another project that was discontinued.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/yannis_">@Yannis_</a> brought this tool to my attention <a href="http://twitter.com/yannis_/status/14281817193">via Twitter</a>.</p>

<p><a class="sidelist" href="http://www.reclaimprivacy.org/facebook" title="Reclaimprivacy.og">Reclaimprivacy.org</a> provides an independent and <a href="http://github.com/mjpizz/reclaimprivacy">open tool</a> for scanning your Facebook privacy settings.</p>

<p>A javascript bookmarklet scans your privacy settings and displays your current public status. Tips are provided to help you tweak your settings section by section.</a>

<p>This tool is in constant development and has been updated twice since I installed it! <strong>Big Kudo to the dev team</strong>.</p>

<p>You can follow <a class="sidelist" href="http://twitter.com/reclaimprivacy" title="@reclaimprivacy on Twitter">@reclaimprivacy</a> on Twitter to keep up-to-date with the latest developments or share this information with your friends on Facebook.</p>
