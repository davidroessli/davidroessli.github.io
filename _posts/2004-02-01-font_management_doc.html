  <p>I don't about you, but fonts problems or font related problems have caused havoc more than once since I permanently switched to Mac OS X back in the 1.1 days.</p>
  <p>A <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040123134139224">MacOSXHint thread</a> points on a very informative document that explains - and clarifies - a lot of potential font issues and how to solve them, where to store them, what format to use, etc. The document is Jaguar (10.2) centered, but a lot of the info still applies to Panther.</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but fonts problems or font related problems have caused havoc more than once since I permanently switched to Mac OS X back in the 1.1 days.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040123134139224">MacOSXHint thread</a> points on a very informative document that explains - and clarifies - a lot of potential font issues and how to solve them, where to store them, what format to use, etc. The document is Jaguar (10.2) centered, but a lot of the info still applies to Panther.</p>

<p>The Apple article is located at,</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/fontbook/">FontBook</a> still remains poorly documented ..</p>
