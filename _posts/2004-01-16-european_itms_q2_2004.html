<p>Jobs announced that iPhoto's print services will be available in Europe sometime in March 2004, but he didn't mentionned anything regarding iTunes Music Store.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/top_news_item.cfm?NewsID=7695" title="Macworld UK - Euro iTunes store this spring?">article in MacWorld UK</a>,</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em;padding-left:0.5em;border-left:1px solid #aaa;color:#aaa;">Music industry insiders expect Apple, Napster and other major digital music services to launch in Europe as soon as the second quarter 2004.<br />
<br />
While Apple remains tight-lipped about plans to introduce its service in Europe, Universal Music's eLabs president Larry Kenswil told Macworld: "By the second or third quarter there will be a number of major services in Europe, and I expect one of these will be Apple's iTunes Music Store."</p>
<p>Sounds cool, no ?</p>
