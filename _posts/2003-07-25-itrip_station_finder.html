<blockquote><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_left.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /> iTrip Station Finder helps you find a spot on the dial where you won't receive any interference from other stations. The application keeps a city-based list of frequencies that are not only clear, but that have clear adjacent channels, as well, minimizing the chance you'll hear crossover from other stations.  <img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_right.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /></blockquote>
