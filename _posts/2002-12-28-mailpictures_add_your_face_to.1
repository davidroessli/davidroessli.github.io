<strong>MailPictures</strong> is a plug in for the Mail application shipping with Mac OS X. MailPictures allows you to have your image show up in your mail message when you send it to a user who has the MailPictures installed. It works completely transparent to the user, no further intervention is required. It also uses the build in mechanism provided by Mac OS X and (optionally .Mac) for storage and display of the images (see AddressBook application for more details). Personally this is not only a very geeky feature of Mac OS X, but an invaluable tool to recognize people who you only know by email.</blockquote>
