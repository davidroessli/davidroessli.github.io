<p>Like many, I discovered <a href="http://www.melodygardot.com" class="sidelist" title="Melody Gardot website">Melody Gardot</a> through her second album "<a href="http://melodygardot.co.uk/album/my-one-and-only-thrill/">My One and Only Thrill</a>" and immediately took to her soft voice and elegant style.</p>

<p>Last night, Fabienne and I had the opportunity to go and listen to her on stage, at the <a href="http://www.theatreduleman.com/">Théí¢tre du Léman</a> in Geneva. <strong>And oh boy, is it a different experience</strong>. Melody Gardot reveals herself on stage! On her last album "<a href="http://melodygardot.co.uk/album/the-absence/">The Absence</a>" she claims to take you on a <em>musical voyage</em> around the world, from Paris to Brazil, and Lisboa to Trinidad. But the truth is (for me) she really takes you in her world when you see her perform on stage!</p>

<h3>Amazing</h3>

<p>Surrounded by a band of exceptional musicians, she mashes up styles and rythms to paint a confused world of delight. She revisits her own songs to share them with you in such a way that you rediscover them entirely. She really takes on on a musical trip.</p>

<p>Her band is composed of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNYmdi3PPLk">Irwin Hall on saxophone</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXvwkCyEAmM">Stephan Braun on cello</a>, Chuck Staab on drums and I can't remember the names of the guitarist of the bass. They are all truly amazing musicians. Thank you all for an astounding performance!</p>
