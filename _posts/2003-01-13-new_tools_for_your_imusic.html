Discoveries of the day: two new hot accessories for your iPod:

<b>Hardware</b>
 <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/itrip/">iTrip, from Griffin Technology</a> is a FM transmitter to listen to your MP3s on your FM receiver. Apparently, you can choose the wavelength among the entire FM spectrum (a plus on former products). Its look is too cool ..<blockquote><img alt="prod_iTrip_tilt_sml.jpg" src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/prod_iTrip_tilt_sml.jpg" width="175" height="175" border="0" /></blockquote>

<b>Software</b>
<a href="http://www.icommune.net/">iCommune</a>, an iTune plug in to stream your music to other iTune users on the net - and not only to your local network (goes further than RendezVous discovery). I'll try that one no later than tomorrow morning!
<blockquote>iCommune is a plug-in which extends Apple's iTunes software to share music over the network. Your friends' music libraries appear in the iTunes source list. You can browse their collections, and choose to download or stream their music. It also allows you to make your own music library available to others.</blockquote>
