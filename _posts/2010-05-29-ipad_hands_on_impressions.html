<p>Yesterday was the international launch of Apple's iPad, released in the US early April. Once again iPad was the talk of the town. I placed my online order on May 10th, and was surprised to receive mine 2 days before the official launch. So, it's still early days, but I wanted to share my first hands on impression.</p>

<h3>The need to touch</h3>

<p>The iPad entices you to touch it. Not only is it how you interact with it, the object itself calls to be touched, almost caressed. The finish is amazing in its precision, There is not a rough edge to it.</p>

<p>Its weight is not insignifiant (680g/730g). It feels light enough to be held in one hand, but two hands are required to operate it. Two hands, thumbs and knees are even better.</p>

<p>It runs the iPhone OS, so as an iPhone user, I was at home the minute I switched it on. The display is stunning. Almost immersive. Having been constrained to the iPhone's 480x320px (163ppi) <a href="/logs/2008/03/iphoned_10_years_after/">for over two years</a> now, the iPad's 1024x768px (132ppi) feels huge, turning the iPhone into something of an <a href="http://twitter.com/Malarkey/status/13841857745">iPad mini</a>.</p>
