<p>I am currently having issues with the way <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture 3</a> deals with timestamps when editing images via a plugin.</p>
<p>It appears that each time I edit an image via a plugin, the time zone changes.</p>
<p>Now, the time zone was properly set when I imported the images into Aperture, and all masters display the proper time and time zone.</p>
<p>The issue only appears when I edit and save an image within a plugin. The timezone is set to that of my computer.</p>

<p>The pictures below show the timestamp of the master and of the edited version:</p>

<img src="https://davidroessli.com/logs/assets/img/aperture_tz_cet.png" alt="Aperture TZ CET" title="aperture_tz_cet.png" border="0" /></div>

<p>This drove me nuts last Sunday when when each edited image disappeared from the image browser after saving it. As the images were sorted by date, I really thought I'd lost the edited image before realising that it was displayed further down, according to its current timestamp.</p>

<p>The master images are in <abbr title="Indian Standard Time">IST</abbr> (<abbr title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</abbr>+05:30) while my current time zone is <abbr title="Central Europe Time">CET</abbr> (or <abbr title="Heure Normale d'Europe Centrale">HNEC</abbr> (<abbr>UTC</abbr>+01:00).</p>

<p>Searching Apple's Discussions, it turns out that there are quite a few threads on this topic:</p>

<ul class="disc">
<li><a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=12815046">Is "Date and Time" totally broken?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=12969817">Time zones and Aperture</a></li>

<li><a href="http://discussions.apple.com/search.jspa?objID=c184&search=Go&q=time+zone">í¢â‚¬Â¦and more</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know if I am doing something wrong, but this misbehaviour gets <strong>very frustrating</strong>.</p>

<p class="update">This behaviour is not linked to the plugin as I <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/roessli/status/31744406218350592">initially thought</a>. It occurs both with <a href="http://niksoftware.com">Nik Software</a> and <a href="http://topazlabs.com">Topaz Labs</a> plugins.</p>
