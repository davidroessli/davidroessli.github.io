<p>An <a href="http://www.oscast.com/stories/storyReader$216">OSCast broadcast</a> (MPEG4) points out that Adobe's <a href="http://www.macinblog.com/mac/archives/000340.php">pcprefered page</a> is authored by a longtime anti-Mac apologist. <br />
<br />
MacCentral has released <a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/2003/03/25/appleresponds/">Apple's response</a> to Adobe's page. (<i>Thanks <a href="http://www.idees.ch/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=340">Maali</a></i>)<br />
<br />
But what's the point of all this? What is Adobe expecting to get out by flaming up the old MHz myth? Why do people buy a Mac? IMHO, it's all a question of usability, working experience, integration, cross application compatibility, etc. I prefer Mac OS over Windows because I can get my job done quicker and in better conditions - and with added personal satisfaction.<br />
Now, let's not forget that a computer is nothing else than a tool - eventhough you might get a different idea by reading this weblog. Basically, it's there to help you create and produce. Sure, some run "faster" than others, but do you actually type or write faster? Edit and create faster? Err..<br />
<br />The Mac experience goes a little further. A Mac tends to be more than just a computer for many people - me included. At the end of the day, I do get the impression that using a Mac adds to my personal work satisfaction. What's your opinion?
