<p>Not only did Apple launch new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod">iPods</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">iMacs</a> yesterday, but appear to be coded in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML</a>.</p>

<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;

<p><a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipod%2F">Eventhough they don't validate</a>, it's still good news. Lets wait to see if that trend spreads to the rest of the site. I wonder if that has anything to do with the <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2003/08/27/the_big_apple.html">Douglas Bowman/Jeffrey Zeldman buzz</a> ?</p>

<p>A <strong><a href="http://guide.apple.com/newarrivals">New Arrivals</a></strong> section that sports information about products that have been released for Mac OS X  updated twice a week. The products cover not only Apple software and hardware, but keyboards, cameras, telephony products and much more. </p>
