Version 1.1 of <a href="http://www.macadvocacy.com/cocoaefax.htm">Cocoa eFax</a> gets better and better. I discovered this little application last year when my fax machine broke down and I was scheduled to receive an important fax ..

Well, it wasn't long before I paid the registration fee and eFax added to the login items of my B&W Mac OS X Server. This application is a model of its kind. Simple yet powerful. Makes (good) use of the operating system's features, and works like a charm. 

The latest version adds print-to-fax in Mac OS X 10.2.4, a spam blocker, an option to email a received fax, and other changes and bug fixes. Cocoa eFax is $10 for Mac OS X 10.1 and up.
