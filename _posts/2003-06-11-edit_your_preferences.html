<p>The info is presented in a standard 3 pane window [<a href="http://www.kuwan.net/images/DefaultsManagerScreen.png">pix</a>]. I haven't tried the demo, but it looks strait forward to me. Guess it could come in handy eventually.</p>
<p>Price is USD 35, with a 10% off if you use coupon "KNDM100BETA" when purchasing while still in beta.</p>
