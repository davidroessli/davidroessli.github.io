<p><b>Fonts organisation</b><br />Did you know that you could organise your font in subfolders now ? While testing Font Agent Pro vs Font Reserve this weekend, I accidentally dropped a folder of fonts in the <code>~/Library/Fonts/</code> and to my big surprise, their appeared in the available font list.</p>

<p>I checked MacOSXHints.com, and the <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2002083106565272&#38;query=font+folders">hint was posted last August</a> (hum, better late than never I guess).</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought I'd let you know, might come in useful to those of you who don't use a font management system.</p>

<p><b>Hide (or display) certain root folders</b><br />The other thing I discovered was how to hide certain directories you'd rather not see in you root directory. There's a hidden file called <code>.hidden</code> at the root of your disk. If you open it, you'll notice a list of directory names. Simply add those you'd rather not see listed (such as <code>Temporary Items</code> or <code>sw</code> e.g.), and they'll be hidden at the next Finder launch.</p>
