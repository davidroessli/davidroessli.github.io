<p><em>These few lines are for a friend in need.</em></p>

<p>This is one of thoses times when you feel something as been ripped out of you. Something so deep and vital, that you are left utterly stunned and empty. What more, there is no rational explanation to backup why this happened. No excuse. No reason. No room. No mercy.</p>

<p>Your most inner self cannot bear the brunt, or accept the simple idea that such a behaviour exists.</p>

<p>Revulsion, nausea, sadness, revolt, sorrow and heartache.</p>

<p>Unfair and undeserved.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, you will grow stronger at the outcome, fill in the gap with more love you ever thought you were capable of. Horizons will broaden and relations deepen. You've got it right. All right.</p>

<p>I feel for you.<br />
Really.</p>

<p>Thought I'd let you know.</p>
