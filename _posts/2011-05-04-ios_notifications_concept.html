<p>While reading my <a href="http://www.zite.com/">Zite</a> articles this morning, I discovered an intriguing and inspiring video by <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.andreashellqvist.se/" title="Andreas Hellqvist">Andreas Hellqvist</a>, demonstrating a design concept on <a class="sidelist" href="http://iosnotifications.wordpress.com/" title="iOS notifications concept Q&A">how to deal with iOS notifications</a>.</p>

<p>Have an app take care of the notifications, their summary and actions to be taken. As well as setting individual notification options for each app.</p>

<p>Revamp the lock screen to enable action to be taken on individual notifications, using the slide metaphore already in place with the "Slide to unlock" button. I would love to add more functionality to my lock screen.</p>

<p>An inspiring concept with lots of good ideas.</p>
