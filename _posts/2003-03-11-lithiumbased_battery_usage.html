title: Lithium-based battery usage
date: '2003-03-11 15:46:59 +0100'
excerpt: A lithium-ion battery provides <b>300 to 500 discharge/charge cycles</b>.
  The battery <b>prefers a partial rather than a full discharge</b>. Frequent full
  discharges should be avoided when possible. Instead, charge the battery more often
  or use a larger battery.

<p>This might interest PowerBook / iBook / cell phone users. According to a <a href="http://www.batteryuniversity.com/parttwo-34.htm">paper on batteryuniversity.com</a>, <blockquote><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_right.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /> [..] a lithium-ion battery provides <b>300 to 500 discharge/charge cycles</b>. The battery <b>prefers a partial rather than a full discharge</b>. Frequent full discharges should be avoided when possible. Instead, charge the battery more often or use a larger battery. <img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_left.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /></blockquote>
Lithium-based batteries have a lifetime of two to three years, and the speed at which the they age is function of temperature and state-of-charge.<blockquote><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_right.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /> If possible, store the battery in a cool place at about a 40% state-of-charge. This reserve charge is needed to keep the battery and its protection circuit operational during prolonged storage. <b>The most harmful combination is full charge at high temperature</b>. <img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_left.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /></blockquote>
The bottom line is to avoid full discharges, recharge more often. Keep the Lithium-ion battery cool but do not freeze. Avoid a hot car. </p>
