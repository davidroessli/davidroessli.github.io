<p>Spent the last 10 minutes cleaning up my Twitter follower's list. <a href="http://www.twitter.com" title="Twitter homepage" class="sidelist">Twitter</a> has just introduced a <a href="http://twitter.com/blog/2007/05/news-and-updates.html" title="Twitter News and updates" class="sidelist">new feature called "block"</a>:</p>

<p><q>We've introduced a new feature lots of folks requested called 
"<a class="sidelist" href="http://help.twitter.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=69" title="Block Help page">block</a>." Blocking someone means that you (and your pic) will not 
appear on the blocked person's friends list, profile page, friends 
timeline, badge, or anywhere else. The person will not be notified 
that they've been blocked, but they will be unable to add you as 
friend. The feature is a hyperlink in the sidebar of Twitter 
profile pages.</q></p>

<p>I'm no longer on thoses profiles with 6000+ friends..</p>

<p>And oh, yes, Twitter supports microformats now - too cool..</p>
