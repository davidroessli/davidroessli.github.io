Here's more information on my choices (actually, most of these applications are always loaded on my Mac):

<ol>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/chimera/">Chimera</a></strong>: my best browser for Mac OS X

Eventhough it's still in beta, you can't beat its page rendering and tab browsing. At last a small and fast browser without all the bells and whistles of a NS or an IE. it is surprising how stable it is for a 0.6. It became my main browser after 20 minutes use.. try it and adopt it. (Use <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/redir.fcgi/kind=1&db=mac&id=15664/ChimeraKnight%201.8.1.tar.gz-link.gz">ChimeraKnight</a> to download the latest build). Cocoa / Freeware.</li><br>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.indigofield.com/">Proteus</a></strong>: instant messenger client for major IM services<br>

Well, if you are into IM, Proteus is for you. It can speak with the major IM services (ICQ, Yahoo!, MSN, AOL/AIM, Jabber,..), it sports a nice UI, entirely built in cocoa, it offers lots of options (personalized away messages, SMS relays, themes, etc.) File exchange is still missing, but this software is still in alpha (!). Cocoa / Shareware.</li><br>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit.html">BBEdit</a></strong>: text editor and much more<br>

I don't think I could manage without BBEdit. I have been using it since version 1.0. The current version (7) offers numerous new features, such as CVS control, vertical text selection (a blessing if you work with fixed width matrices), syntax coloring, and much much more. Carbon / Commercial.</li><br>

<li><strong><a href="http://softobe.com/products/flsy/pp.html">Folder Synchronizer</a></strong>: keep your data in sync<br>

If you happen to work on different computers as I do, this little application will save your life. I use it to sync my e-mail, bookmarks, current projects and downloads between my two workstations and my TiPB via my iPod. Not only does your data stay in sync, but it offers a backup option which saved my ass more than once. Carbon / Shareware.</li><br>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a></strong>: efficient diagrams, charts and graphics<br>

Need to draw diagrams ? Charts ? Try OmniGraffle. A beautiful UI, with many intelligent tools will lead you to produce stuning graphics and diagrams. You can create your own sets of reusable objects, or download them from the net. Very intuitive, simple, and efficient. A real Mac app. Cocoa / Commercial.</li><br>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a></strong>: intelligent todo lists<br>

Another OmniGroup app. The ideal application to maintain to-do lists, project ticklers, or any hierarchical data. Print nicely too. Cocoa / Commercial.</li><br>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.glu.com/products/weatherpop/index.html">WeatherPop</a></strong>: menubar weather report<br>

I wiouldn't I couldn't live without this one, but I do like to have the weather forcast of my favourite locations handy up in the menu bar. There's nothing like dreaming of Kerala's 27 C when you are deep under the grey Geneva winter. % days forecast, current temperature, humidity, wind, visibility, sunrise & set, etc. Cocoa / Freeware (advanced version is shareware).</li><br>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.matthewdrayton.com/desktopconsole/">Desktop Console</a></strong>: display your logs on the desktop<br>

I know many of you consider this as geekware, but it it damn handy to have the content of a log file display on your desktop. Especially the FTP or web server one. Defaults to system log. Saves a window, nicely customizable. Cocoa / Shareware.</li><br>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/jaguar/mail.html">Mail</a></strong>: Apple's build in e-mail client<br>Why mention Mail.app ? Well, I was an eternal Eudora user, used it from version 1.3 through 5.x, switched to Entourage when Mac OS X became my main OS (May 02), and chose to give Mail.app a chance after Jaguar was released. Eventhough it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of an Eudora or an Entourage, it is beautifully integrated in Mac OS X, and uses the system's Address Book. It is a small app, which works very nicely. It imported my 20K+ messages without a problem. It's junk mail filter (baysiean like Spamsieve) gives good results. It catches 90% of my junk, with no false positives. This app will be beefed up in the following releases. In the meantime, you can add plug-ins which enable PGP, priorities, inserts the user's picture from Address Book, and more. It deals properly with IMAP accounts too. There's a lot of talk around this app in Usenet and Apple groups, but it suit my needs. Give it a try. Cocoa / Built in Mac OS X.</li><br>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/isync/">iSync</a></strong>: Apple's solution for keeping your address book in sync<br>

Okay, this my hopeful-new-year-resolution-wish-in-the-sky. Still in beta, not doing a very good job, restricted and slow, but the idea is fantastic. Imagine keeping in sync your Mac(s), cell phone and PDA address books .. through the touch of one button. Wishful thinking ? Maybe, but a nice try either way. Let's wait the end of the beta testing period, or maybe MWSF, to know more about the future of this concepts (support for new phones ? PDA ?) Cocoa / Freeware.</li>

</ol>
