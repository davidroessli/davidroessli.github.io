<p>I like the way the information is organised. It reminds me a little of the support forum. The hierarchy feels logic (well, it suits my logic anyway). The topics are clearly outlined, with informative sidebar links to relevant internal or external resources. The search engine is a powerful way of finding what you're looking for. This reference will stand in good place in my reference bookmarks.</p>
<p class="quote">A comprehensive collection of Apple technical resources, including Documentation, Technical Notes, Sample Code, Technical Q&#38;As, and Release Notes. Each of the links below leads to the resources for a specific topic. Key resources also include Getting Started documents, API references, and cross-references for related topics.</p>
