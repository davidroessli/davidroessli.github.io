Dave Hyatt's weblog on Safari. Dave Hyatt is a member of the Safari team at Apple. He works primarily on the WebCore, the open source portion of Safari that contains KHTML (as well as the implementation of the Qt subset required to support KHTML).

Lots of very interesting info for anyone interested in Safari.
