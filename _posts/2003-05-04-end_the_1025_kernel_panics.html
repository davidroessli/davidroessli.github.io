<p>Posted on <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20030430064613322">MacOSXHints</a> on Friday, this tip help us out too. You can address the <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20030425110922787">kernel panic problem</a> that appeared for a lot of us by <b>downgrading the USB drivers</b> (kernel extension).

The USB kernel panic in 10.2.5 seems to be a pretty universal problem.  No word from Apple yet that I can discern, except the instruction to disconnect the offending hub.  However, hope is at hand. Buried in the iMac (Flat Panel) discussion group at apple.com is a comment by  A. Brody that the USB kernel panic issue in 10.2.5 can be fixed by retrograding the IOUSBFamily kernel extension.  You can <a href="ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Development_Kits/Mac_OS_USB/IOUSBFamily-1.9.7-log.dmg.bin">download</a> the IOUSBFamily installation software to install an older version of the driver.
