  iCommune: well, the bottom line is quite impressive. Basically, it enables you to stream your iTunes library anywhere on the net, or browse (and copy) MP3 tracks from another iCommune-enabled user. In that respect, it goes far beyond RendezVous.

  Cool.

Well, the bottom line is quite impressive. Basically, it enables you to stream your iTunes library anywhere on the net, or browse (and copy) MP3 tracks from another iCommune-enabled user.

The setup is trait forward. Drop iCommune in iTunes plug-in folder, launch iTune and configure iCommune by clicking the new button on the bottom.
Sharing note: you must specify the real path of iTunes Library, it doesn't seem to work through symlinks, or aliases, and web sharing must be turned on.

I tested the streaming locally on a 100Mb network and through my home DSL connection. I noticed no slowdown or any sign of network activity on my local network. The DSL connection worked seemlessly too, except for a single rebuffering event. If you add several servers, they show up as separate 'Network' icons in the left pane, followed by the name you gave them : Network (lab) e.g.

I'm streaming while I write this blog .. real cool.
