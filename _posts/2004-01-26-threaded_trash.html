<p>Who would have guessed that the "Empty Trash..." task was threaded ?</p>
<p>Yes, I ctrl-clicked the Trash while it was emptying .. and don't ask me why. I guess that the number of items was so large, and having issued the command earlier on - like 15" - I forgot until the window pop-up from under another.</p>
<p>Just a Monday curiosity.</p>
