<p>This might come in handy depending where you're stranded: a <a href="http://www.keyspan.com/products/cables/K-ZIP-CELL-ER/">USB Cell Phone Charge Cable</a> charges your phone from your PC or Mac's USB port.  Includes 6V booster. Use this cable with our wall adapter or cigarette lighter adapter for additional charging options. </p>
