<p>The MacBook Air and the latest Mac Mini don't have an internal SuperDrive, but can <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1777" class="sidelist" title="MacBook Air, Mac mini: How to use Remote Disc to share DVDs or CDs from a Mac or Windows-based computer">share a DVD or a CD from another Mac</a>.</p>

<p>At the time or writing, this is not true for the MacBook Pro. My previous post explains <a class="sidelist" title="How to make the MacBook Air SuperDrive work with any Mac" href="/logs/2012/03/how-to-make-the-macbook-air-superdrive-work-with-any-mac/">how to use the MacBook Air SuperDrive with any Mac</a>, but you might be interested to simply mount a DVD/CD from another Mac (or Windows conmputer).</p>

<p>Type the following commands in Terminal to enable Remote Disc to appear in your Finder sidebar:</p>

<p><pre>defaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser EnableODiskBrowsing -bool true
defaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser ODSSupported -bool true</pre></p>

<p>â€¦ and restart your Mac.</p>

<p>This is useful tip when you've swapped out your optical drive from your MacBook Pro.</p>
