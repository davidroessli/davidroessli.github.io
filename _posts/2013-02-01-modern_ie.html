<p>Microsoft is pushing the use of HTML5 and CSS3 more than ever. They have just released an online testing plateform to help you support Internet Explorer: <a href="http://www.modern.ie/">modern.IE</a></p>

<blockquote class="line">A new set of tools to help you support modern and older versions of Internet Explorer</blockquote>

<p>I <a href="http://www.modern.ie/report#http%3A%2F%2Fcybmed.com" title="Scan Cybermedia Concepts" class="sidelist">ran cybmed.com through their scanner</a> and was pleasantly surprised to discover that it passed all tests. The 'Browser detection' suggestion refers to <a href="http://haveamint.com" title="Mint" class="sidelist">Mint</a> (web site analytics) using browser detection somewhere in its JavaScript. Nothing dramatic.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can download virtual machines with IE 6 to 10 installed for local testing or there's a 3 month trial offer to <a href="http://www.browserstack.com/" title="BrowserStack virtual testing" class="sidelist">BrowserStack</a>.</p>

<p>This service is very encouraging as it shows more than ever that we are all rowing in the same direction.</p>
