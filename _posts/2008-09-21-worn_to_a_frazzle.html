<p>Having a long breakfast today while trying to catch up with the endless unread items of my <acronym>RSS</acronym> feeds which are well into the four figures. Just thought I'd say hi somewhere in between .</p>

<p>I'd love to have a go at cleaning up my numerous drafts in order to post those still relevant. If I don't find the energy, I'll probably just crash out with the kids, play board games or take them to the pictures.</p>

<p>Make me strong.</p>
