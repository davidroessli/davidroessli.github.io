<p>There are days when the hardware lets you down. I've noticed a significant increase in the frequency of hardware failures these last years, part of them related to quality control (see below).</p>

<p>More personally, I've been experiencing a <em>hardware failure prone</em> state recently. In less than a week, My <a href="http://www.ricoh.com/r_dc/gr/gr_digital/" title="Ricoh GRDigital">Ricoh <abbr>GRD</abbr></a> digital camera died, my iPod Nano crashed beyond restore and my <abbr title="MacBook Pro">MBP</abbr> suffered from a Bluetooth hardware failure.</p>

<p>It is a sad story, for which I bear the full responsibility. <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/" title="The Future of Web Apps London 2007">FoWA</a>'s second day had just wrapped up, and we were enjoying a pint of beer before heading for the <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.lestroisgarcons.com/" title="Les Trois GaríƒÂ§ons">Restaurant Les Trois GaríƒÂ§ons</a> near <a href="http://rubyurl.com/v3S" title="Google map">Shoreditch</a> for the evening. The light was low and I propped up the camera on the rim of my pint glass. Framed <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.mathiascurrat.com" title="Mathias Currat" rel="friend met co-worker">Mathias</a>, set the selftimer and leaned back. Then I repeated the previous sequence, with the camera aimed at myself. The instant before the shutter opened, the camera fell in my pint of beer. Incidentally, it took the picture <em>through the beer</em>, and a fuzzy one of Enrique after that in a desperate last breath. Damn.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the dinner at the Restaurant Les Trois GaríƒÂ§ons was a great success. Thanks Mathias.</p>


<h3 id="bluetoothunavailable">Bluetooth unavailable</h3>

<p>The next day, we flew home from London with British Airways, and my <abbr title="MacBook Pro">MBP</abbr> got showered with water while the flight attendant handed an overfilled glass of water over me. I was shocked by lack of responsiveness of the crew. I understand accidents happen, but at least I take my responsibilities when I cause one. The crew was arrogant and disdainful to say the least. Anyway, 5 days later the bluetooth hardware vanished, the fan rotation speed shot up to 7'000 rpm and the <abbr>MBP</abbr> overheated - even while sleeping. After 90 minutes on the phone with Apple Support, a hardware failure was diagnosed and I handed my <abbr title="MacBook Pro">MBP</abbr> over to <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.macrepair.ch" title="MacRepair: Apple Authorized Service Provider">MacRepair</a>. I hate doing that.</p>

<p>Eventhough <a class="sidelist" href="https://davidroessli.com/logs/2007/01/my_backup_paranoia/" title="My backup paranoia">I have a full backup</a>, I don't like parting with my notepad, I don't like the idea of giving admin access to it while I'm not nearby. It's only a material object, like <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.enriquepardo.com" title="Enrique Pardo Photographies" rel="friend met co-worker">Enrique</a> likes to remind me. He's right of course, but I can't ignore the emotional bond that ties me to my notepad. I must confess that just after leaving, I spied the receptionist through the window to see how she was handling it. Pathetic, no?</p>

<p>Is the <abbr title="British Airways">BA</abbr> incident related to the hardware failure? I don't know, and I don't care to tell you the truth. There is a <a class="sidelist" href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=740623&tstart=0" title="Bluetooth not working?">thread on Apple Discussions</a> that relates to this kind of hardware failure. I am just looking forward to welcoming my <abbr title="MacBook Pro">MBP</abbr> back home.</p>

<h3>Poor initial quality control</h3>

<p>This comforts me in thinking that the level of hardware quality control has lowered seriously these last years. The first <abbr title="MacBook Pro">MBP</abbr> I received last October was <abbr title="Dead on arrival">DOA</abbr>, a brand new one was sent out from Shangai. Disk drives tend to fail more often. I lost two and witnessed 5 crash beyond repair over the last 12 months. Having said that, the number of disk drives we use increased too over the same period. Google has published an <a class="sidelist" href="http://216.239.37.132/papers/disk_failures.pdf" title="Failure Trends in a Large Disk Drive Population (PDF 244 Kb)">interesting article on hard disk testing</a> they performed on their disk drive population.</p>

<p>I fought a lost battle with <abbr>MGE</abbr> last autumn regarding a <a href="http://www.mgeups.com/products/pdt230/smallups/ellipsep/ellipsep.htm" title="MGE Pulsar Ellipse Premium">Pulsar Ellipse Premium</a> UPS that didn't work properly. The <abbr>USB</abbr> interface stopped working after a few days. After numerous e-mails and registered letters, they acknowledged the problem and sent out a replacement unit while they repaired mine, but both the replacement unit and the repaired on failed just the same way (note: the postage was on me). After that, they suddenly stopped responding to my e-mails and letters agin. I eventually got tired of fighting and acquired an <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=SUA750I&total_watts=50" title="APC Smart UPS">APC unit</a> that works flawlessly for my server while I use the Ellipse on my workstation (which I shutdown every evening). Don't buy an MGE Pulsar Ellipse Premium if you intend to rely on its <abbr>USB</abbr> port or count on its 5 years warranty.</p>

<p>Don't trust your hardware or a pint glass. Backup often. Get an extended warranty (<a class="sidelist" href="http://www.apple.com/support/" title="Apple Support">AppleCare</a> <em>e.g.</em>). Be ready to fight for your rights.</p>
