<p>Back at <a class="sidelist" href="http://liftconference.com/" title="List Conference 2010">Lift</a>. This is my 4th edition and the vibes are still as good. The workshop formula has changed this year: instead of concentrating the workshops over the Wednesday preceding two days of conferences, they are spread out over the mornings of three days, the afternoon's being dedicated to the conference sessions.</p>

<p>A lot of things are happening this year. Check out the program. Lift Experience. I'll try to share my thoughts over the course of the following three days. Just for the fun of doing it.</p>

<p class="update">The recorded videos and live stream are available on <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.livestream.com/liftconference" title="Lift Conference Videos">http://www.livestream.com/liftconference</a></p>
