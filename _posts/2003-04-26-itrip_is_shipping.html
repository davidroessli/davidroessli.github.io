Thank you for your email.  After a slight delay, the iTrip is finally coming!!  Look for the iTrip to hit the street on or around April 25th.  The units are in production as we speak and between the manufacturing process, batch testing, and shipment receipt, we are establishing a two week lead time for completion.  According to the production schedule, product should be shipping in every day.  As fast as they can make them, they are supposed to ship them.  that should mean a minimal inconvenience to tackling latter pre-orders.  We apologize for the delay and look forward to bringing you the iTrip.<br />
