<p>At 2:26pm four years ago my life changed course. We were three. We'd been preparing this moment for the last nine months or so. But you never really know what it's all about before you get there.
<br />
Now, a little somebody actually depended on us. A little soul that was to become the most important thing in our lives. I couldn't imagine it was possible to love as much, as deeply and as truly as I love you.
<br />
Happy birthday my son. Time to leave for home to get your b'day party ready! Let the fun take over..</p>
