<p>Shaun Inman has just released <a href="http://www.haveamint.com/" title="Mint, a fresh look at your site">Mint v2.0</a>. A major update to what has become an invaluable website usage stats tool.</p>

<p><abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> aside, I noticed the following enhancements,</p>
<ul>
<li>full support for IE6+ including admin (lots of clients asked for this);</li>
<li>improved page loading time;</li>
<li>group your referrers by domain in the referrer pane;</li>
<li>no longer tracks identifiable information by default (eg. ip addresses) to prevent conflicts with existing privacy policies;</li>
<li>the watched pages display referrers now;</li>
<li>searches now list web and images;</li>
<li>an RSS feed tracker (Bird Feeder) - haven't tried it as I use <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.feedburner.com" title="FeedBurner">FeedBurner</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>An extensive <a href="http://www.haveamint.com/about/feature_highlights#new-in-2-features" title="What's new in v2.0">list of new features</a> is available, as well as a <a href="http://www.haveamint.com/about/demo" title="Live demo of Mint v2.0">live demo</a>. There's extensive help online, along with <a href="http://www.haveamint.com/about/screencasts_and_screenshots" title="Screenshort and screencasts (QuickTime required)">screenshots and screencasts</a> and a new forum.</p>

<p>First impression rocks. Well done Shaun.</p>
