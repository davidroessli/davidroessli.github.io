<p>Google's new free e-mail service, <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">GMail</a>,  doesn't support Safari (yet). You get 1Gb free storage with Google's search engine (<em>Don't sort, search</em>).</p>
<p>Among the notable features, you'll find,</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a message and all relate message are highlighted (threads, replies)</li>
<li>Customisable spam filter</li>
<li>No popups, no ads - but relevant text-ads <em>&#224; la Google ..</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The service is still in beta, and widely available, and English is the only language available at the time of writing.</p>
<p>What should we think about this new service? After indexing the web, usenet, weblogs (Blogger), Google will track our e-mail content..<br />:/</p>
<p>PS: noticed today's cool date? 04-04-04</p>
