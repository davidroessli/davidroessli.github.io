If you thought Apple's 23" was big .. <a href="http://www.presence-pc.com/news/newsv3.php?news=47">checkout this one</a>.
;)

Between you and me, I can't really imagine what you can do with such a ugly monster, except play games and waste space.. Moreover, 2 million pixels is ridiculous for such a size (Apple's 23" displays 2.3 million pixels!).

.. and the beast costs USD 20K++
