<p>Looking for something completely different, I fell on the following <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107392">Knowledge Base article which explains what Safe Boot and Safe Mode are</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, <i>Safe Boot</i> is a special way to startup your Mac and repair your HD, and <i>Safe Mode</i> is the state in which your computer is right after that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <i>Safe Boot</i> doesn't give any feedback of what it's up to, or if something has been fixed or not. <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=30837">Booting in Single User Mode</a> and running <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106214">fsck</a> is much more informative.</p>
