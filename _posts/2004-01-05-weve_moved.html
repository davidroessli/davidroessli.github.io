<p>My other personal weblog <strong>www.davo39.org</strong> has now moved to TypePad.  I used the same procedure than with <a href="http://www.macinblog.com/">www.macinblog.com</a>, and everything went smoothly.</p>
<p>I still haven't decided on the language of this weblog. most of its current posts are in French, and I fell like implementing a multilanguage weblog. Today, I'm more inclined to write in English. So, I'll be clearing up the categories in the near future, and writing in English, except when it's meaningless.</p>
<p>The next step will be to migrate my <a href="http://roessli.net/">HomePage</a> photo albums to TP.</p>
