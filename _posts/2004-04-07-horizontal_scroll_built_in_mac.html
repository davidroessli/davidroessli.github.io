<p>Have you tried the latest <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/info/product.aspx?view=22&#38;pcid=d6eea0b8-4d31-45ae-9437-6dafaef1eba4">Microsoft Wireless Optical mouse</a> ? What interested me to try was the new scroll wheel, which gives you the smoothest scroll I have ever experienced, and the possibility to scroll horizontally by tilting the scroll wheel to the left or right.</p>
<p>The scroll experience is awesome, unfortunately the <em>ergonomic</em> design of the mouse gaves me cramps in the wrist, and the horizontal scroll required the Microsoft driver to be installed.<br />
:(</p>
<p><strong>But I discovered quite by accident this morning that horizontal scrolling is built in Mac OS X.</strong> (for as long as you own a scroll wheel mouse)</p>
<p>Hold the shift key down while using your scroll wheel, and the content scrolls horizontally.</p>
<p>This is not new. <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031012013331284&#38;query=horizontal+scroll">MacOSXHints published this hint</a> back in October 2003 - but I was quite pleased to stumble upon it by accident!</p>
