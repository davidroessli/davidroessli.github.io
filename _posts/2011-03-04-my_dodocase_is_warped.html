<p>My original <a href="http://www.dodocase.com/" title="DODOcase" class="sidelist">DODOcase</a> didn't survive the winter.</p>
<p>I am not a case person; not for my iPhone, nor for my iPad. But there are some beautiful designed cases out there, and among my favourites are DODOcase and <a href="http://www.hardgraft.com" title="Hard Graft" class="sidelist">Hard Graft</a> products. The DODOcase accompanied me all summer, but I switched to the Hard Graft case when the cold crept in. It just felt right.</p>
<p>The DODOcase spent the winter months in the cupboard while the iPad travelled in its wollen glove.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that the bamboo dried up over the course of the winter, warping it into a curve that can't welcome the iPad anymore.</p>

<p>So, <a href="http://www.dodocase.com/pages/care" title="Take care of your DODOcase" class="sidelist">be careful</a> how you store your DODOcase, as it might just end up as mine. Eventhough I didn't expose it to direct sunlight or overheated environments, it didn't resist.</p>

<p>I've <a href="http://dodocase.zendesk.com/home">sent a note to the nest</a> to see if they can help me out. Will post their answer later.</p>
<p>Boo.</p>
