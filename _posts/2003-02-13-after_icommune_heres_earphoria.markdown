Here's another iTunes remote controller, <a href="http://www.blackholemedia.com/beta/">Earphoria</a><blockquote><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_left.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /> Using rendezvous hocus-pocus, Earphoria automagically locates all Earphoria enabled Macs on your network. The instant you connect to one, Earphoria is beamed the available music library. You can now play, pause, skip and search your music in one unobtrusive interface. With a single keystroke you can pop open your music anytime, anywhere on your network!

Apparently, there's 2 applications: One on the server side, and one for the client. Looks cool, but I haven't tried it for real..
