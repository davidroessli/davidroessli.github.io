<p>There's a hole in my recent &ndash; activity &ndash; life.</p>
<p>I've been offline since the end of June following the discovery of a <a class="sidelist" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_stone" title="Kidney stone (Wikipedia)">kidney stone</a> (nephrolithiasis) lodged in my upper urinary tract that was surgically removed on my birthday (#sigh).</p>

<p>Although the operation went well, the recovery process took longer than I expected. I was down and out for over a week, and I'm still not feeling a 100% as I write these lines 10 days later.</p>

<p>The funny thing about recurrent pains, like renal colic, is that I tend to expect it to come back even if I know the stone has been removed and all is good. I listen too closely to body signs that might indicate something is off (#pfff).</p>
<p>Anyway, this is why I've been off color these last two months, and have shied away from social networks and social activities.</p>
<p>Hopefully, <a class="sidelist" href="http://usa-2016.tumblr.com" title="From LA to NYC - a travel blog">our upcoming trip to the USA</a> will complete my recovery and I'll be bouncing back even higher in August!</p>
