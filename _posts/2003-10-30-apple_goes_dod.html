<p>While searching for something else, I fell on an article that provides the <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25526">manual for the Apple Federal Smart Card Package Installation</a> and Setup Guide in PDF format. It's been mentionned elsewhere that Panther comes bundled with logos of various US government departments, so it may seem that the Department of Defence might be adopting the Mac OS.</p>
