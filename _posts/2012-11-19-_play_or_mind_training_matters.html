<p>I discovered «<a class="sidelist" title="« Play »" href="http://www.east-man.be/en/14/11/Play">Play</a>» this morning.</p>

<p>A choreography danced by <a href="http://www.shantalashivalingappa.com/" class="sidelist" title="Shantala Shivalingappa">Shantala Shivalingappa</a> and <a class="sidelist" title="Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui" href="http://www.east-man.be/en/people/161/Sidi-Larbi-Cherkaoui">Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui</a> <strong>I would love</strong> to go and see.</p>

<p>Just imagine, two of my favourite dancers and choreographers united in the same production: a dream. This ballet is dedicated to Pina Bausch who had the idea to match these two personalities.</p>

<blockquote class="line">« Play » is both a passing of time, and a vast playground, a place for experiments, for reaching out. An attempt to not be alone, with the desire to participate in the movement of the world rather than to be a passive spectator. 
<br />
<br />In such a game, there is also the awareness that in the playing lies the very meaning of our presence here, (which is) fleeting and real.</blockquote>
