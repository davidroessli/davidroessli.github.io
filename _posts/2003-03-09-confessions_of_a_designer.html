<p><a href="http://enriquepardo.com/">Enrique</a> sent me this interesting confession:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/articles/confessions/">My name is Doug, and I'm a recovering Windows user</a>.</blockquote>

A die-hard Mac fanatic that chose Windows over Mac OS in the late nineties, and is reconsidering his dependency on Windows and taking a closer look at Mac OS X..</p>
