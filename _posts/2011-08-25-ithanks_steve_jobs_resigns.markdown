We all knew this was going to happen soon or later, but <a class="sidelist" title="Apple Press Info: Letter from Steve Jobs" href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/08/24Letter-from-Steve-Jobs.html">Steve Jobs' resignation as Apple CEO</a> still came as a shock as I read my morning feeds.

As always, it did it his own way. So be it, I just hope this doesn't bode badly for his health.

Thanks for inspiring me over the years and giving me an outlook that goes far beyond from providing me with the tools which have become those of my trade.

Good luck Steve.
