<p>Apple has finally recognised the problem with the <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/01/14/228225&#38;tid=180">iBook's logic board</a> by publishing an <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/ibook/faq/">extended exchange program</a> and offering to reimburse previous costs of repair to eligible customers (iBook purchased in the last 3 years). Reuters comments the problem an article "<a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=technologyNews&#38;storyID=4062623">Failing Apple Hardware</a>".</p>

<p>I fell on this piece of information while reading an interesting commentary "<a href="http://news.osdir.com/article434.html">Having Bitten the Forbidden Fruit, it Bit Me Back. Six Times</a>" on OSDir.com on a Linux user feeling guilty of using Mac OS X instead of Linux, and all the trouble he had with his iBook logic board.</p>

<p>Check it out if you are an iBook user - or not - you might be entitle to the logic board exchange.</p>
