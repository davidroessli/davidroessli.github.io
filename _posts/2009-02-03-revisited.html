<p>«Stop all the tweets, power off the phones, <br />
Prevent Mail from beeping with its shiny tones,<br /> 
Silence the podcasts, put up the black sail, <br />
Close the weblogs, and let the silence prevail. </p>

<p>Let the webcams' white noise crackle ahead <br />
Scribbling on retinas the encrypted message He Is Dead, <br />
Set IM statuses to offline, <br />
Let the CPUs gently decline. </p>

<p>He was my North, my South, my East and West, <br />
My working week and my Sunday rest, <br />
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; <br />
I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong. </p>

<p>RSS feeds are not wanted now: unsubscribe from every one; <br />
Pack up Flickr and dismantle the network; <br />
Pour away all scrobbles and burn Facebook.<br />
For nothing now can ever come to any good.»</p>

<p class="update">Following «<a class="sidelist" href="/logs/2008/11/were_not_friends/" title="We're not friends">We're not friends</a>» posted earlier this year, I savagely plagiarised <a class="sidelist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden" title="W.H. Auden on Wikipedia">W. H. Auden</a>'s «<a class="sidelist" href="http://www.wussu.com/poems/images/another_time_4.jpg" title="«Funeral Blues» illustration»">Funeral Blues</a>» - don't ask me why, it just came like that.</p>
