<p>I've been playing around with a number of Twitter clients which offer push notification in one way or another, and the the closest I got to finding what I'm looking for was <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.polarbearfarm.com/tweetpush/index.html" title="Tweet Push">Tweet Push</a>.</p>

<p>Tweet Push isn't a Twitter client but more of a Twitter sidecar. It runs side-to-side to your favourite Twitter iPhone client (currently Tweetie, Twitterrific, Twittelator, and TwitterFon) and received Twitter push notification on the iPhone.</p>

<p>It requires a Polar Beer Farm account that can be setup from the iPhone, but the Twitter Push settings are available only via the website.</p>

<p>Tweet Push allows you to control various aspects of how you are notified on your iPhone:</p>

<ul class="disc">
<li>Choose between 2, 5, & 10 minute check interval.</li>
<li>Change the alert sound.</li>
<li>Enable notifications from your general status timeline.</li>
<li>Enable the text of the last tweet to be pushed to your phone.</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to know that Tweet Push costs just USD 1, and includes a month of service. After that, each month costs another USD 1 via in-app purchasing (prepay). It works well, and it is the closest I've found to emulate the SMS notification we all once used to haveâ€¦</p>
