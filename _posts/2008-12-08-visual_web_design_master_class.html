<p>Here are a few notes I took during the «<a class="sidelist" href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/events/08-london" title="Visual Web Design Master Class London 2008">Visual Web Design Master Class</a>» by Andy Clarke on December 1st, 2008.</p>

<p>I had an inspiring day listening to <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/company/about#ac" title="Andy Clarke">Andy Clarke</a>and <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.brendandawes.com/" title="Brendan Dawes">Brendan Dawes</a>. After a <a class="sidelist" href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/guerilla_venue_switching/" title="Guerilla venue switching">bumpy start</a>, the day turned in to rich event throughout which I met great people and came back boosted and motivated to do what I do.</p>

<p>I met to clean up these { raw } notes, but you know how things are, time flies, etc. so I thought I'd just log them here. My <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davo39/sets/72157610796387958/" title="Flickr Set">photos are available on Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>Focus on the _creative_ aspects, and not so much on the tech side.<br />
Started @media 2005 - 20 conferences since.<br />
Little design related things.</p>

<ul class="disc">
<li>Find new ways to be inspired.</li>
<li>Be playful</li>
<li>Bending rules is acceptable</li>
<li>Rethink your thinking</li>
<li>Better typo through classic techniques</li>
<li>Combinig ancient and modern layouts</li>
<li>Make designs that stand apart from the crowd</li>
</ul>

<p>Working from home. Hard to keep motivated sometime.<br />
How do you keep the motivation going.</p>

<p>[Typeface Whitney Bold: good for titles and body copy]<br />
[Gotham Bold guest typeface: good for heading - more rounded for body copy - Obama used it]</p>

<p>Venue is also sponsored by letter Qq - for questions</p>

<p>Georg Lichterberg (1742-99) satirist "Everyone is a genius at least once a year. A real genius has his original ideas closer together"</p>

<p>Limitations we put on ourselves in terms of web design</p>

<p>Robert Frost "The brain is a wonderful organ. It starts working the moment you get up in the morning and doesn't stop until you get into the office"</p></p>

<p class="update">Finding new way to be inspired.</p>

<p>So many people will look at websites (<a href="http://www.csselite.com">http://www.csselite.com</a>, etc. loads of them) <br />
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/splat/sets/981332">http://flickr.com/photos/splat/sets/981332</a> (screen garbs of pages)<br />
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/factoyjoe/sets">http://flickr.com/photos/factoyjoe/sets</a> (screen grabs of details)<br />
It should be more</p>

<p>Cyndili has stared to archive iPhone login screen</p>

<p>We need to look away from the web - more. The web is useful, but they are only part.<br />
Learn about what is around us.</p>

<p>Currently, we focus more on the science of we design, and less on the design, creative aspects. Web design is like product design? Like you was designing a washing machine…</p>

<p>iPhone: not as many as we thought. Super easy to use - but we LOVE to use it. We ADORE this thing.</p>

<p>That is what matters when we start thinking about websites. What happens to them and what they feel.<br />
Cab rides: you remember the experience, not the journey it self. Doesn't matter how long (e.g. flying). What matter is what happens on it.<br />
Design is about emotion - feelings.<br />
The experience that we create.</p>

<p>As adults we fall into patterns. Why do kids have more imagination? So much more less self conscious about things. They play. More expressive, more imaginative, they break rules - because they don't know the rules are there.</p>

<p>Designers need to be more like children. Experience more. Challenge perceptions about design. "What if" t-shirt. More of that.</p>

<p class="update">What if online banking worked more like Twitter!</p>

<p>Change our perception. Changing your ideas. Keeping the brain fed with inspiration.</p>

<h3>How to get ideas</h3>

<ul class="disc">
<li>Get more inputs</li>
<li>Learn to take risks</li>
<li>Mistakes are good</li>
<li>Bend rules</li>
<li>Give yourself more constraints</li>
</ul>

<p>Gather as many inouts as e can from as many diff inputs. GEt away from that comfort zone. What if game.</p>

<p>Jemes Webb Young<br />
"An idea is nothing more or less than a combination of old elements"</p>

<p>There is nothing new about iTunes. It is the experience. Convergence of different inputs.</p>

<ul class="disc">
<li>Read a short story every day - take time out for this</li>
<li>Read a poem every day</li>
<li>Drive somebody else's car</li>
<li>Look up - urban areas tend to be the same - but 20 feet up, they _are_ different</li>
<li>Swap your iPod with a friend - see how that affects your mood</li>
<li>Read classified ads</li>
<li>Watch a movie (Bollywood?) - Andy's favourite movie? Gone with the Wind - Angelheart</li>
<li>Learn to ride a motorcycle - a foreign language</li>
<li>Take a different route to work evey week - start to notice things, different architecture, lots of different everything</li>
</ul>

<p>We forget how to look, to see - too focus</p>

<h3>GET OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE</h3>

<p>Those things that most people don't notice that matters. Feel. Sense.<br />

Take 5 blocks - fill w/white    95% - 5%<br />
Use complementary colours gives a palette </p>

<p>Zoom in  as far as PS will take you - pixel of colour schemes</p>

<p>Lear to take risks</p>

<p>"What if" I apply these colours to ..?</p>

<p>Kids take risks all the time. Remember that making mistakes is okay. </p>

<p>Typography, texture: what can we do to take element from layout, typography, texture that may not be directly related to what we are designing. Colour combinations.</p>

<p>Art of seeing. Creativity. Why must everything be _safe_? Why can't we scare our users, force reflections, thinking.</p>

<p>We need constraints. Focus. Give yourself less time. Jason Fried and Co built Basecamp in 2 weeks.
Give yourself less of everything.</p>

<h3>We need constraints to challenge us</h3>

<p>People tend to imagine constraints that aren't there. "I can't do this because of.."</p>

<h3>Better typography</h3>

<p>Setting  type is an art/craft - knowing/understanding the little diffs that makes it looks right. Understanding the fundamental principles.</p>

<p>Bringhurts "Typography must often draw attention to iself before being read"</p>

<p>webtypography.net (Bringhurst to the web by Richard Rutter)</p>

<p>Web typography absolutes (5) - not always 'absolute' - not for everybody, not in every case</p>

<p>Better typography terminology</p>

<p>The typographical scale (size)</p>

<p>em square that goes around the char<br />
with different typefaces we get different sizes (72px sq box containing a 72px char)</p>

<h3>Pattern and grids</h3>

<p>Common sizes<br />
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 14 16 18 21 24 36 48 60 72</p>

<p>Invisible rythm - around for 100 th years</p>

<p>Some have names</p>

<p>36 double great primer<br />
24 double pica<br />
12 pica<br />
6 nonpareil</p>

<p>Structure - scale, communicate the importance</p>

<p>48 section headers h1 { font-size: 218% or 2.25em or 3.6em}<br />
36 second level header<br />
24 tertiary<br />
18 other<br />
12 body  h1 { font-size: 12px or 100% or 62.5% }</p>

<p>Baseline grid &amp; vertical rythm (leading - line height)</p>

<p>The Wasteland - TS Eliott<br />
Audio recording avail on the net read by the author</p>

<p>Leading refers to the space between the baselines</p>

<p>The leading will change according to the typeface you are going to use (blueprintcss warning)</p>

<p>Rule of thumb: the amount of leading you want to put between the lines is almost equiv to a lowercase t</p>

<ul class="disc">
<li>body copy almost always needs positive leading</li>
<li>leading for shorter txt box -> shorter leading</li>
<li>darker needs more leading (sans serif fonts do)</li>
<li>increase leading with larger sizes</li>
</ul>

<p class="update">If it feels right then it is right</p>

<p>Typographical colour: squint at it - medium gray is right.</p>

<h3>Baseline grid</h3>

<p>12px 1.5 ratio, 18px baseline<br />
h1 18x2 = 36<br />
All images are multiples of 18px tall<br />
sidebar 10px -> too must leading, too open</p>

<p>Nominated baseline every 5 lines<br />
heading : 3 lines<br />
body: 4 lines<br />
sidebar: 5 lines</p>

<p>[[ Bolton talked about this at @media 2007</p>

<p><em>The measure</em><br />
The measure is the number of chars you can get on a line</p>

<p>Reverse text out -> increase leading slightly, lighten the font too, increase tracking</p>

<p>Control the length of lines (66 chars?) between 52 and 78 is ideal<br />
important: the measure will change according to the typeface you choose</p>

<p>How can we improve the type w/o being over complicated?</p>

<p><em>Hanging punctuation</em></p>

<p>Move bullets out of the column to align text (hang or indent punctuation)<br />
Quotations: exactly the same thing.<br />
Blockquote (use a line out in the margin)</p>

<p><em>Quotes and apostrophes</em></p>

<p>" vs «<br />
… vs ...</p>

<p>Letterspacing strings of capitals, small caps and digita<br />
letter-spacing: .1em to &lt;abbr&gt; and &lt;span&gt;<br />
Hyphens, en-dashes and em-dashes</p>

<p>Dividing a word co-workers : shortest of all - regular<br />
Range of values 3rd - January - 1922 :  en-dash shorter dash<br />
Break for thought, pause for breath â€” longer dash - em-dash</p>

<h3>Enhance typography</h3>

<p>Paragraphs<br />
Indent first line w/o space between paragraphs (a sq 2.1em) don't indent first line</p>

<p>Pilcrow divided (para symbol)</p>

<p>Elevated cap on first para<br />
Drop cap on first para (first line all caps)<br />
Outdented caps (caps in margin)<br />
End marks (stop icon)</p>

<p>Choosing the best ampersand</p>

<p>Improving headings with negatives line height, leading, letter-spacing<br />
Control widows<br />
Big typeface creates the left with negative indent (letter C G O Q S T U V W Y) until it feels right</p>

<h3>Brendan Dawes - Scissors</h3>
<p>"Analog in - digital out"</p>

<p>Scissors more usful than pencil -Truman Capote</p>

<p>Use time in web design<br />
Inspiration from film making (insert time 'nothing' in sequence -> emphasis added)</p>

<p>When you go away from the default, it makes people sit up, listen, look up and use your stuff?</p>

<p>Always a good thing - generally</p>

<p>Brnd touch points (bookstore wraps books up in brown paper)</p>

<p>Make lots of stuff, get it out there</p>

<p>Slitscans 1px wide -> right<br />
Cinema Redux - name it, brand it<br />
DoodleBuzz - news aggregator</p>

<p>Rearrange the rules to suit yourself</p>

<p>Building inpiring layouts</p>

<p>2 columns, sidebar - main<br />
The fondations needs logic</p>

<p>They are better ways to structure the pages, give things order.</p>

<p>CSS Framework<br />
960 grid system <a href="http://960.gs">http://960.gs</a></p>

<p>If you don't know why you are using something, things become 'samy' - </p>

<h3>The golden section 1.618</h3>

<p>We don't find a good practical reason of using this natural proportion</p>

<p>Start off with a line: 940px</p>

<p>940 / 1.618 = 580px (content area) 360px sidebar<br />
swing up the 580px -> golden rectangle (area above the browser fold stuff)</p>

<p>Take a sq out of it, you are left with another golden rectangle</p>

<p>Fibanacci 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 ..</p>

<p>Arrange Fibonacci grids and build, twist layout - grid building techniques</p>

<p>It's not the grid we have that matter, it is that we have one.</p>

<p>Symmetrical grid based columns - use gs ratio to create the margins</p>

<p>Rectangle</p>

<p>Vertical heights are equaly important<br />
proportions that mean something</p>

<p>Root rectangles<br />
Root two rectangles. Ratio 1:1.1414</p>

<p>940 -> 665 root 2 rectangle. Canevas to fit things in<br />
Draw a diag topleft - botright. Any rectangle with botright on diag will be perfect ratio (proportion)<br />
Gives you the size of images that go in it</p>

<p>Gives you a system, takes the guess work out.</p>

<p>Root three rectangle. Ratio 1:732 (3 col)<br />
940 -> 543</p>

<p>Root four rectangle. RAtio 1:2 (4 col)<br />
940 -> 470</p>

<p>Experiment with diff technique for calculating how big things should be.</p>

<p>Start off with a fixed width: multiply things up with GS (1.618)</p>

<p>Modular grids</p>

<p>Symmetrical modular grid<br />
Modules is golden rectangle or square (more modernist?)</p>

<p>Combine grid methods</p>

<p>Nothing wrong on developing grids based on different methods</p>

<p>Head margin<br />
Margin from between the fields at the top of the grid too.</p>

<p>Foot margin<br />
Same issue</p>

<p>Having the grid is what is important</p>

<p>Order in one part and chaos in another. May work. Depends on content.</p>

<p>Create a grid from photo (Flickr)</p>

<p>Newspaper grids<br />
Focus on one event and search for litle details<br />
Lot of inspiration you can take from print newspapers</p>

<p>Traditional broad sheet newspapers<br />
8 columns as starting point<br />
More modern use 6 cols<br />
Often there is a seventh slightly wider col on left or right<br />
The measure gives the nb of cols<br />
Measure based on typeface, how many cols you can fit on paper</p>

<p>Text over multi col layout? Where we can control, myabe we should<br />
Header span over multi cols -> story hierarchy</p>

<p>Comic book<br />
Frank Miller<br />
Watchmen<br />
Dave Gibbons<br />
Alan More</p>

<p class="update">Use white space to give people to think…</p>

<p>Paul Chadwick<br />
Concrete</p>

<p>Panel size determins how long the reader will spend reading it/looking at it</p>

<p>No border - leave the eye free to wonder out - time - add emphasis<br />
Contrary to what is don on the web</p>

<h3>Essence of time</h3>

<p>Lead the viewer's ee around the page from where it starts to where we want to reader to end up.</p>

<p>You don't have to use the same grid on the sme page. More than one grid on the same page.<br />
Main content - one grid, forefront<br />
Secondary content - other grid, defocused, at the back</p>
