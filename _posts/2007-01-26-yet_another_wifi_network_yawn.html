<p>Another WiFi network appeared in <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.istumbler.net/" title="iStumbler">iStumbler</a> this morning, which brings the total to ten. There were two (mine included) back in 2001 when I moved in, and four last summer. I'm actually hooking into private networks from across the road.</p>

<p>I was monitoring my wifi neighborhood to check if the latest <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/airportextremeupdate2007001.html" title="AirPort Extreme Update 2007-001">Airport Update 2007-001</a> solved my <abbr title="MacBook Pro">MBP</abbr> airport issues, while the <a class="sidelist" href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=715044" title="Airport reception problem on brand new MacBook Pro Intel Core 2 Duo"><abbr title="Core 2 Duo">C2D</abbr> airport problems thread on Apple Discussions</a> gets longer and longer.</p>

<p>So far, I've suffered no disconnection, no bandwidth reduction, no wake-up reconnection problem since I installed the update this morning. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>Update: just when I tried to post this entry, the network dropped. Drats.</p>
