<p><a href="http://twitter.com/beautifulweb/statuses/905674221" title="Twitter launch">Yesterday</a>, Andy Clarke launched <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/" title="For A Beautiful Web!">For A Beautiful Web!</a>, a site presenting a series of master classes and workshops on creative design and training for the web.</p>

<p>The initial master class <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/announcing/visualdesign_08/" title="Visual Web Design Master Class" class="sidelist">"Visual Web Design Master Class For A Beautiful Web"</a> is scheduled for December in London and focuses on how to discover new ideas and new ways of working.</p>

<p>The classes will be intimate as they are limited to 40 people. I must admit that I am very tempted by December's initial class, more so as I have only attended one conference this year. There is an early bird í‚Â£70 discount for the first ten registrations for those who think fast.</p>

<p>You can preregister your interest for <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/classes" title="Master Classes for 2009">next year's classes</a>, which main themes cover advanced css styling, microformats, accessibility and markup.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to see how Andy will master these one day courses. The <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/" title="Carson Workshops">Carson Workshops</a> he's given where a great success, both in the UK and in the US. Some of which were given twice. I am confident he's going to come up with new ways to inspire and enlighten those who are fortunate enough to attend these events.</p>

<p>I am fortunate enough to have followed Andy's talks at the yearly <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia/" title="@media Conference">@media conferences</a> ever since his first, back in 2005. He is an inspiring figure and always delivers a topnotch talk which boost you with a new drive to change and better the way you work, design or code. Passionate.</p>
