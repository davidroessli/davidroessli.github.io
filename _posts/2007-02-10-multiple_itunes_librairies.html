<p>I've been playing around with <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/" title="iTunes 7">iTunes 7 multiple librairies</a> function, and I must admit it works as advertised.</p>

<p>I've been looking for a solution that enables me to <strong>share</strong> a library among multiple Macs, along with its copy protected files (<abbr title="MPEG 4 - Part 14">.m4a</abbr> files), the ability of burning CDs, adding files and synchronising iPods. I never found anything that worked with the 50<abbr title="Giga Bytes">Gb</abbr>+ of digital music I own. A server based solution wasn't an option because I didn't want a server running full time at home (my wifi network shuts down at night).</p>

<p>My current solution is a 'music' account on the family iMac that streams to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/" title="Apple Airport Express">Airport Express</a> hooked to the music center. The iMac automatically logs in to that account and makes the music available via Front Row. A limitation to that model is that when I wish to add music, edit playlists, add posdcasts, I need to do it throught the music account on the iMac (directly or via <abbr title="Apple Remote Desktop">ARD</abbr>). I acquire most of my music through my <abbr title="MacBook Pro">MBP</abbr>, ripping it or via the iTS, so it's not ideal. </a>

<p>iTunes' feature of selecting a library at startup along with <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/" title="Apple Airport Extreme">Apple's new Airport Extreme</A> might be a beginning of a solution. Launch iTunes with the option key depressed - like Photo - and it will prompt you for a library. Point it to a iTunes Library file and Bob's your uncle. The library can be stored locally, on an external drive or a server volume, it works like a charm. Moreover, iTunes remembers that last library loaded (in case your forget to press on option).</p>

<p>Now imagine your library on an external drive hocked to your Airport Extreme. The music account could load it by default when launched. Working on my <abbr title="MacBook Pro">MBP</abbr>, I could access my entire library when I'm at home, and carry a subset with me when I'm on the road. The iMac can be offline, the library remains accessible.</p>

<p>The only downside is how do you backup?. The drive needs to be <abbr title="">USB</abbr>, and most affordable USB external drives don't offer <abbr title="Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks">RAID</abbr> 1 security, and thoses that do are big, and noisy. Nevertheless, this solution might fit in my current backup scheme, where the music drive would be backed up through my <abbr title="MacBook Pro">MBP</abbr> during its <a href="https://www.davidroessli.com/logs/2007/01/my-backup-paranoia/" title="My backup paranoia">regular backup cycles</a>.</p>

<p>Hmm. Would I be looking for an excuse to upgrade to <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/" title="Apple Airport Extreme">802.11n</a>?</p>
