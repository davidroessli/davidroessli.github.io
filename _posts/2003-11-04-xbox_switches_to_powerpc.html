<p>Guess what: Microsoft is switching to IBM's PowerPC chip (yes, the same you find in Apple's Macs) to power its playstation, the Xbox. (source <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,61065,00.html">WIRED</a>).</p>

<blockquote><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_left.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /> There's quite a bit of irony here, he [Richard Doherty of IBM] added, referring to the fact that it has always been assumed that Apple would move to Intel, rather than Microsoft moving to the PowerPC, a chip technology co-developed by Apple, IBM and Motorola. <img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_right.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /></blockquote>
