<p>I quite accidentally fell on this piece of valuable news this weekend while building a iDVD project: <strong>you can run iDVD on a G4 without a SuperDrive installed</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=93274">iDVD 3.0.1 KB article</a> says just that</p>

<blockquote><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_left.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /> Starting with version 3.0.1, iDVD can be used on any Macintosh computer with a PowerPC G4 or G5 processor to create DVD content. However, the option to burn the finished DVD is only available on computers with a built-in SuperDrive. iDVD 3 may be included with your computer, even if it does not have a SuperDrive. <img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_right.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /></blockquote>

<p>Cool, no ?</p>
