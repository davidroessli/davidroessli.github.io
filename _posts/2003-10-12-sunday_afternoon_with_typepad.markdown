Okay. Here we are.

This is my first post with typepad. I must admit that I am most impressed by the way Six Apart have wrapped up MT into a user-friendly application.

I am still a fan of movabletype for its speed and extensiblity, but I must admit that typepad feels good.

<strike>I would appreciate the option of using a custom domain name instead of the .blogs.com or .typepad.com that is currently offered. But I guess that might come</strike>.

18:16 update: I've just discovered the <strong>Domain Mapping</strong> option which enables you to point a domain name towards a typepad blog! Kudo Six Apart!

The layout and design templates are cool too. I guess there's a typepad look&feel that is going to spread itself. Actually, it's by visiting a weblog that I remembered I signed up for a typepad account early August, and never took the time to really explore it. 

I've been having fun with the moblogging option, <a href="http://wild.blogs.com/photos/r3mote/">uploading pics from my T610</a> - rather disappointed by their quality, but the fun remains.
