In fact, I bet Apple could get this process to run smoothly enough that loading PC software would differ only slightly from launching Mac programs. <img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_left.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /></blockquote><p>If you want to give Bochs a try, download it from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12580&release_id=135273">SourceForge project page</a>, or check out <a href="http://openosx.com/wintel/">OpenOSX WinTel 1.0</a>. Interestingly, multiple G4 CPUs can be utilized and are emulated as a single powerful Pentium processor or as dual Pentium Processors. Virtual PC files are compatible, and can copied over from the Finder. </p>
