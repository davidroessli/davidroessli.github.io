<p>Didn't get half of I wanted to do this week, but the spirits are high at the week-end's dawn. The sun is out, the air is almost warm. I'm working with the windows open. Everything has a warm goldy hue about it. The shadows are long and skinny.</p>

<p class="dict"><strong>chirpâ€¢y</strong> |Ëˆ ch É™rpÄ“|<br />
adjective ( <em>chirpâ€¢iâ€¢er , chirpâ€¢iâ€¢est</em> ) informal<br />
cheerful and lively</p>

<p>Like Rasmus Lerdorf said last year at the <a class="sidelist" href="/logs/2007/02/after_fowa_london_2007/" title="FoWA 2007 in London">FoWA 07</a> in London, my flow of <a class="sidelist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin" title="Wikipedia's definition of oxytocin">ocytocin</a> must be high.</p>

<p>Feeling connected. Solving one problem at the time. Making the world a better place. Gee, must I be high. Just wanted you to know.</p>
