<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 24px; line-height: 110%; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-top: 4px;" title="TITLE">The Disk Copy utility in Mac OS X 10.2 or later allows you to burn to the same disc two or more times until it is full. This is known as creating a multi-session CD.</p>

<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 24px; line-height: 110%; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-top: 4px;" title="TITLE">To create a multi-session CD, use the Disk Copy utility to create a disk image file from which the CD is burned. Follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drag the item or items you wish to burn into a folder.
<li>Open Disk Copy (/Applications/Utilities/).
<li>Drag the folder onto the Disk Copy window. The Image Folder dialog appears.
<li>Choose a location for the image file using the Where pop-up menu. For simplicity, you may choose Desktop.
<li>Click Save. Wait for the image to be finished.
<li>Choose Burn Disc from the File menu.
<li>In the navigation dialog that appears, select the image you just created, then click Burn. If you have not already inserted a blank disc, you will be prompted to do so now.
<li>In the Burn Disc window, click the disclosure triangle.
<li>Select the checkbox for "Allow additional burns".</ol>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 24px; line-height: 110%; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-top: 4px;" title="TITLE">A disc burned with this setting will remain open to subsequent multi-session burns.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 24px; line-height: 110%; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-top: 4px;" title="TITLE"><b>Additional burns on same disc</b><br>
When performing additional burns on the multi-session disc, simply repeat Steps 1 to 7. The "Allow additional burns" setting selected in Steps 8 and 9 should automatically be retained for that disc on subsequent burns. Each new burn session on the disc will appear in the Finder as a separate disk, and it will have the name of the disk image file from which you burned it.</p>
