This week's discovery: a Mac OS X application to manage your Movable Type weblog. Edit, preview, publish. A real treat.<br>

I need to keep the editing up know (if my <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000264.htm">cholecystitis </a>permits it..)<br>

<a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/">Kung-foo.tv</a> {chaotic intransient prose bursts} is well worth a visit too ..<br>

<a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/probeta/">NetNewsWire Pro</a> currently in beta, does a good job to, eventhough I prefer Kung-Log's strait forward approach (eventhough I can't edit a recent post). NetNewsWire doubles as a RSS feed reader and NotePad. The good side is that it isn't limited to MT weblogs, it supports Blogger, Radio and others.<br>

NetNewsWire Lite is a sole RSS reader, and does a good job of it adopting OutLooks's familiar 3 pane interface:<br>
