<p>Simon Thornton presents an interesting idea on his weblog ("<a href="http://www.mutualmisunderstanding.com">a mutual misunderstanding</a>"): connect a DV input device to your Mac and make iChat believe it's a firewire cam ..</p>

<p class="quote">In other, shorter, easier, words: you can use your converter box to stream live video from something - oooh, let's just say your Sky Digibox for example - to someone else using iChat anywhere else in the world.
