<p>Sorry for those who experienced domain mapping problems. It seems that I didn't configure the move correctly, and that <strong>macinblog.com</strong> was left out in the cold. The URL to use for the time being is <strong>www.macinblog.com</strong>. But you know that already if you're reading this..</p>

<p>The other problem I'm having is mapping the former post permalinks to the newer ones. I've got a bunch of fake files with redirects in their headers, but I have to upload them one by one .. so It'll probably take until early next year.<br />;)</p>

<p>I'm working on Macinblog's best of 03, and hope to share it with you sometime tomorrow, if I find the time to finish it.</p>
