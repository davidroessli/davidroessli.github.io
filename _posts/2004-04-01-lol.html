<p>Can't stop laughing..</p>
<p class="quote">I won&#8217;t spare the niceties: what Doug Bowman and Stopdesign have done is disgraceful and unprofessional.
<br /><br />
For a so-called &#8220;Design Consultancy&#8221; to rip off the work of another for its own site shows a total lack of regard for others in the profession, and undermines &#8212; no, cheapens &#8212; the industry as a whole.
<br /><br />
What makes this particularly heinous is that not two weeks ago, Mr. Bowman had the audacity to talk about CSS Theft in front of a packed conference room at SXSW2004. In one ear, out the other&#8230;?
<br /><br />
A sad day for those of us working on the web. Please feel free to go over to Stopdesign and make some noise in protest.</p>
