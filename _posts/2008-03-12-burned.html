<p>It's a bright new day. I remember this day, nine years ago as if it were yesterday.</p>

<p>Some events just burn into your memory cells forever. More than a turn in my life, it was an opening. An opening to the world, to the present, « here and now ». A new little human being was born, and I was trusted to take care of him for a while.</p>

<p>Amazing.</p>

<p>Words can't convey what I feel, and I am too clumsy to spell it out clearly, so you'll have to read between the lines. <em>Open lines</em>. I am a rich man.</p>

<p><em>Happy birthday Mathias.</em></p>
