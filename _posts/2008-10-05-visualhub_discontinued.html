<p>I first heard about <a href="http://www.techspansion.com/" title="Techspansion" class="sidelist">Techspansion</a> closing through <a href="http://twitter.com/lynxman/statuses/945312060" title="Lynxman's tweet">lynxman's Twitter feed</a> before reading the notice that is displayed when you launch the application.</p>

<blockquote><p>...After much soul-searching (it's not you, it's me), for personal reasons, Techspansion is closing its virtual doors.</p>

<p>I loved this video converter application, and its little brother <strong>iSquint</strong> as well as <strong>AudialHub</strong>, the audio file converter.</p>

<p>It was a bit what <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.lemkesoft.com/" title="GraphicConverter">GraphicConverter</a> is to still images. Offering support for a large variety of video formats and was both easier to use for basic conversion while offering a greater number of advanced options for video geeks. A rare combination.</p>

<p>There is no real competition. <a class="sidelist" href="http://homepage.mac.com/major4/" title="FFMpegX">FFMpegX</a> does the same thing (uses the same underlying open-source code <a href="http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/" title="FFmpeg" class="sidelist">ffmpeg</a>), but the GUIs just don't match up.</p>

<p>Hold on to and <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.isquint.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=8;t=6936" title="How to backup VisualHub">backup your copies of VisualHub and AudialHub</a>.</p>

<p>Missing you already.</p>

<p class="update">All software seems to have been removed from the server. For those wondering where they can still grab a copy, point your browsers at <a href="http://mactalk.cachefly.net/dump/VisualHub.dmg" title="VisualHub installer">http://mactalk.cachefly.net/dump/VisualHub.dmg</a>.</p>
