<p>Like many I suppose, I discovered <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.kttunstall.com/" title="KT Tunstall's website">KT Tunstall</a> during her live session at the <a class="sidelist" href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/s83522y/event/index.html?internal=g4h5jl83a" title="Apple Special Event September 2007">Apple Special Event</a> on September 5th (Tip: scroll to 01:14:30 of the webcast to view her performance). I thought she gave a stunning performance in front of a audience of computer geeks and Apple shareholders. I was enthralled by her overall energy and sound of her voice. Eyes closed, she sounded almost like an afro-american soul singer. Needless to say I bought her first album <a class="sidelist" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=118827630&s=143459" title="Eye to the telescope on iTS">Eye to the Telescope</a> only minutes after having pre ordered my <a href="https://davidroessli.com/logs/2007/09/ipod_touch_first_impressions/" title="iPod Touch first impressions">iPod Touch</a>.</p>

<p><a class="sidelist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KT_Tunstall" title="KT Tunstall on Wikipedia">KT Tunstall</a>'s second album was on pre order at the time. Drastic Fantastic, produced by <a class="sidelist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Osborne" title="Steve Osborne on Wikipedia">Steve Osborne</a>, might seem a little more tamed at first, but it just a first impression. I was very much immersed in the acid-tongued, smart, self powered energy and the glitzy sound of her first album when I first listened to it. It grows on you. There is a kind of 1997 flash back, with massed acoustic guitars, a carefully controlled voice and the smooth beats. But she puts it all together in a very personal way. Each track with it own personal specificity. Not only does she take up where she left, but certainly moves on too.</p>

<p>On certain tunes, you can't help but to think of <a class="sidelist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrissie_Hynde" title="Chrissie Hynde on Wikipedia">Chrissie Hynde</a>, <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.pjharvey.net/" title="PJ Harvey's website">PJ Harvey</a> or <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.pattismith.net/" title="Patty Smith's website">Patty Smith</a>, except that KT Tunstall is well in to today's stream and pop vibes. She certainly hasn't said it all.</p> 

<p>She's a free element. Free to play with her high-gloss folkie style and mix it up with professional pop smarts. Don't tell her that this album is everything but a sequel to <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=118827630&s=143459" title="Eye to the telescope on iTS">Eyes to the Telescope</a>.</p>
