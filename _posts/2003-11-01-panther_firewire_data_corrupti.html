<p>Apparently, Apple has narrowed the problem with Firewire 800 corruption down to an <strong>Oxford 922 chipset</strong> used by some external firewire enclosures (source <a href="http://www.eetimes.com/semi/news/OEG20031031S0066">EETimes</a>, and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/firewire800specialmessage.html">Apple's official press release</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Other World Computing</strong> is offering a <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/Reviews/Framework.cfm?page=/hardwareandnews/oxford/oxfordandpanther.html">FireWire 800 firmware update</a> for their Mercury Elite FW800 external drives.</p>

<blockquote><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_left.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /> While Oxford Semiconductor and Apple Computer disagree over what has led to this issue (there is absolutely no issue under any circumstance with OS 10.2.8 and earlier), Apple has confirmed that the issue is limited to firmware v1.02 and prior. <img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_right.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /></blockquote>

<p>The patch is also available through <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/21396">VersionTracker</a>.</p>

<p><strong>LaCie</strong> has also published a <a href="http://www.lacie.com/news/news.htm?id=10059">announcement</a> on their website regarding their FW800 external drives.</p>

<p><strong>WiebeTech</strong> follows suit for their Fire800 and MicroGB+800 products with an announcement on their <a href="http://www.wiebetech.com/techsupport.html">tech support page</a>, and offers an firmware updater.</p>
