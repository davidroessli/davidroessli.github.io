<img align="right" hspace="10" alt="antivirus_logo.gif" src="/assets/macinblog/img/antivirus_logo.gif" width="90" height="80" border="0" />I just happenend to notice that <a href="http://mac.com/">Virex 7.2 is available to .Mac members</a>. Virex automatically checks for the most recent updates now (eUpdate), but <a href="http://www.macinblog.com/mac/archives/000209.html#active">still doesn't offer any active protection</a>..

Funnily enough, Virex 7.2 comes bundled with November 13th, 2002 DAT files, eventhough I had the latest weekly definitions installed for Virex 7.1. At first launch, it prompts you for your admin password and downloads the latest definitions (Jan 29, 2003).

It doesn't seem to take into account your previous settings. "Automatically scan at login" was checked. The eUpdate function is set to launch when you <b>open</b> Virex 7.2. I don't believe that checks for definitions on a regular basis (cron job) or at login.

So I guess that those of us who installed <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/moreinfo.fcgi?id=17452&db=mac">Bruno Courbage's Virex 7 shell scripts</a> or <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/moreinfo.fcgi?id=17600&db=mac">Beri Rinaldo's Get DAT Updates</a> can keep using them.

Topic: Does Virex Have AutoProtect Feature?

In both thread, the answer is,<blockquote>Virex does not have any automatic scanning capabilities. You have to launch it for it to run, and you have to pre-select whatever you want it to scan. 

Hope this answers your question.
