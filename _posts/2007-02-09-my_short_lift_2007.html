<p>The <a href="http://www.liftconference.com/2007" title="LIFT07 | A conference about the challenges and opportunities of technology in our society">Lift Conference 2007</a> is wrapping up while I write these lines. I didn't manage to attend it as I initially planned to. I was going to spend Thursday and Friday following the conferences and socialising. The reality turned out that I only attended <a href="http://www.liftconference.com/2007/lift/program/friday" title="Friday's programme">Friday</a> morning's conferences.</p>

<p>Maybe it's a side effect of registering for a conference in your hometown. Maybe one is more susceptible to pick choose who and what you are going to listen to when the conference center is a bus ride away. Maybe one is more prone to give in to workload temptations. Maybe I'm just looking for excuses.</p>

<p>Anyway, the vibes were good. I liked the atmosphere and the crowd. Riding the tram 15 back down to the office, I regretted not spending more time at the <a href="http://www.cicg.ch/" title="International Conference Centre Geneva - Switzerland">CICG</a> mingleling with the mix of designers, developers, content providers, journalists, photographers, academics and so on who attended this year's edition. The mix was rich and colourful.</p>

<p>I barely took he time to walk through the <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.liftconference.com/2007/lift/liftplus" title="LIFT+ a place + a concept + 10">Lift+ hall</a> with my friend <a class="sidelist" href="http://imago.enriquepardo.com/2007/02/10/lift_2007.php" title="Enrique Pardo Photographies" rel="friend met co-worker">Enrique</a> and take a few <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davo39/tags/lift07" title="My 'lift07' pix on Flickr">cameraphone shots</a> of the giant printout productions laying on the floor.</p>

<p>Coming up next in ten days is <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/" title="The Futur of WebApps">FOWA 2007</a> in London. We'll be three of us this time. Attending full time.</p>
