<p>Another longtime Macintosh software publisher closes down (July 3rd). Among others, <a href="http://www.casadyg.com/">Cassady &#38; Green</a> published the indispensable <b>Conflit Catcher</b>, <b>Spellchecker</b> and <b>SoundJam Pro</b> which was to become iTunes.<br />
<br />
Other favourites included <b>Crystal Quest</b> and <b>Glider Pro</b>. The advent of Mac OS X put C&#38;G in a difficult position. Other companies have suffered from the same syndrome.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, we are witnessing a [re]birth of software developers and  publishers for Mac OS X such as <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/">OmniGroup</a> with OmniGraffle, or <a href="http://www.panic.com/">Panic</a> with Transmit.</p>
