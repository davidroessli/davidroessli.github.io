Wouldn't you like to be able to display "<b>All e-mails received today</b>", "<b>Flagged e-mails</b>", or e-mails in relation a specific address, sent out on a specific date/date range, etc. A little bit like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/entouragex/">Entourage</a>, but much nicer.



They could appear in a tabbed view of the mailbox drawer.



What do you think of that ?
