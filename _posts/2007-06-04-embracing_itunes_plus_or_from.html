<p>Apple launched their <abbr title="Digital rights management">DRM</abbr> free music (256kbps <abbr title="Advanced Audio Coding">AAC</abbr>) last Tuesday by creating a new entity of the iTunes Store called <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30itunesplus.html" title="Apple Launches iTunes Plus">iTunes Plus</a>. All of <a  class="sidelist" href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/04/02itunes.html" title="Apple Unveils Higher Quality DRM-Free Music on the iTunes Store">EMI's catalog was to be offered in <abbr title="Digital rights management">DRM</abbr> free form sometime in May</a>, and user would be offered the possibility of upgrading the tracks they own for a minor fee (the actual difference between the price they paid and the new price). What I understood too was that if you'd acquired the album, as opposed to buying singles tracks, you would be gracefully offered the new <abbr title="Digital rights management">DRM</abbr> free high res album free of charge.</p>

<p><strong>The actual picture is somewhat different</strong>. I must have misread the announcement, or taken my dreams for reality, because I was unable to find that last offer on their site. On the other hand, you are able to upgrade your existing library, but only in its whole. This means either you pay to upgrade all your tracks and albums, or you don't. You can't for instance upgrade some tracks/albums and not others. You can't choose. Oops.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="iTunes Store">iTS</abbr> offers to upgrade all your former purchases even if the original tracks have been moved off your computer at some point. On the good side, the album price of the new iTunes Plus store remain the same as the former one, meaning that if you select to buy an album, you'll be downloading the <abbr title="Digital rights management">DRM</abbr> free one, even if you buy it from the regular iTunes Store.</p>

<p>This appeals to me because I tend to buy more albums than single tracks. A generation thing I suppose. Old habits die hard. I started buying <abbr title="Long playing vinyl">LP</abbr>s around the age of 12 or 13 years old. I remember cycling home from the record store with the album carefully wrapped up and stored between the break cables of my bike. Hours were then spent exploring the cover art, reading the lyrics, listening to the music. I didn't compulsively acquire music as I do today back in those days. It was a real and important event.</p>

<p>So, Wednesday, <em>call me Mr Compulsive</em>, I clicked the "Upgrade my Library" button without thinking twice, and began to download the 180+ tracks or so from iTunes Plus. It took me over four attempts spaced out over three days for all the tracks to home in safely. The load must have been tremendous, and there must be a number of sysops that lost sleep these last nights. I was confident they eventually would get there, as I have a good experience with iTune Store's error recovery procedure. I encountered a wild number of errors 500 and 504. But it was all sorted out eventually.</p>

<p>The 256kbps encoded tracks weight between 5 and 8Mb and {I must subjectively admit} sound better. Subjective? What the heck. That is how I hear them today. I haven't, and probably won't, play around comparing them as I, for one, have deleted my previous <abbr title="Advanced Audio Coding">AAC</abbr> protected 128kbps tracks <sup><a href="#notreally" title="No, they are not really deleted">â€ </a></sup> (you can opt to move them out of the folder or delete them), and, for two, haven't the time currently to enjoy that kind of exercice.</p>

<p>Most of my music library is in <abbr title="Digital rights management">DRM</abbr> free format as it originates from the CDs I acquired over time. I've been buying music online since the former iTunes Music Store was available in Switzerland (back in May 2005 according to invoices I tracked down in my mail). My buying habits switched rapidely to focus essentially on the <abbr title="iTunes Store">iTS</abbr>. The number of boxed CDs I acquire has rapidely decreased ever since. At first, I took the habit of burning for backup purposes and ripping back to a <abbr title="Digital rights management">DRM</abbr> free format the albums bought on <abbr title="iTunes Store">iTS</abbr>, but I have now passively renounced to rip them back and hence the introduction of the <abbr title="Digital rights management">DRM</abbr> free tracks suiting me down to the earth.</p>

<p>I have used 192kbps <abbr title="MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3">MP3</abbr> up until now, but I changed my import settings to 256kbps after listening to my newly downloaded tracks. Initially, I chose to <abbr title="MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3">MP3</abbr> for portability purposes, but <abbr title="Advanced Audio Coding">AAC</abbr> is widely supported now and does sound better at that encoding rate. Especially classical music and some jazz.</p>

<p>It is funny to see how the formats and their use evolved over time (for me):</p>

<ul>
	<li>1975-1985: <abbr title="Long playing vinyl">LP</abbr>s and compact cassettes</li>
	<li>1985-1990: <abbr title="Long playing vinyl">LP</abbr>s, compact cassettes and <abbr title="Compact disk">CD</abbr>s</li>
	<li>1990-1995: <abbr title="Compact disk">CD</abbr>s and compact cassettes</li>
	<li>1995-1999: <abbr title="Compact disk">CD</abbr>s and <abbr title="Min Disks">MD</abbr>s</li>
	<li>1999-2005: <abbr title="Compact disk">CD</abbr>s and <abbr title="MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3">MP3</abbr> (remember <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.panic.com/audionstory/" title="The true story of Audion">Audion</a>?)</li>
	<li>2005-2007: <abbr title="Compact disk">CD</abbr>s, <abbr title="MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3">MP3</abbr> and <abbr title="MP4 files with audio streams encrypted by FairPlay Digital Rights Management as sold through the iTunes Store">MP4p</abbr></li>
	<li>2007- : <abbr title="Audio-only MPEG-4 files">MP4a</abbr> (and <abbr title="Compact disk">CD</abbr>s?)</li>
</ul>

<p>This post is getting much longer than I anticipated, so I'll leave you here and get to work. It's Monday morning, 08:45 CET, the sun is shining and all my thoughts go to Mum entering hospital for her bi-yearly checkup.</p>

<p id="notreally" class="fotnote" style="margin-top:2em;font-style:italic;font-size:0.9em;"><sup>â€ </sup> deleted? well not really, I do keep backups of everything. But they are deleted from my active computers.</p>
