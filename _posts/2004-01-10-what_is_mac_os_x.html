<p> Amit Singh's <a href="http://www.kernelthread.com/">kernelthread.com</a> publishes a milestone article on "<a href="http://www.kernelthread.com/mac/osx/" title="2004-01-09 by Amit Singh: This document attempts to give a hacker over-friendly answer to the question "What is Mac OS X?". My original motivation in writing this was that somebody had proxy-volunteered me to give a talk introducing Mac OS X to the Linux Users Group at my work place.">What is Mac OS X</a>" targeted at those members of the technical community who are not familiar with it, notably the Linux User's Group at his work. </p>
<p>A low level article - quite technical by moments, which complements all the higher level ones you can find on the net. A milestone.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/01/07/1615230">thread on Slashdot</a> on this article.</p>
