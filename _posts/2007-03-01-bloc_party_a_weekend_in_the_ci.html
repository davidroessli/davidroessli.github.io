<p>I discovered <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.blocparty.com/" title="Bloc Party">Bloc Party</a>'s first album <em>Silent Alarm</em> back in April 2005 while spending a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=berne%202005&w=39601377%40N00" title="A few Flickr snaps">weekend in Berne</a> at <a class="sidelist" href="http://cmpg.unibe.ch/people/excoffier.htm" title="Laurent Excoffier" rel="friend">Laurent</a>'s house. I still remember my surprise and amazement at hearing that spiky guitar rock and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kele_Okereke" title="Kele Okereke on Wikipedia">Kele</a>'s voice that recalled so much of <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.thecure.com" title="The Cure">The Cure</a> at their best.</p>

<p>Needless to say I bought the album immediately and have been waiting for the next ever since. The few remixes they released last year weren't up to it, and I was beginning to wonder if it would ever be released.</p>

<p>It was worth the wait. It is a very different album. The first thing you notice are the changes in the voice. It has evolved and sounds much richer. The overall music has evolved from a dry 1980 rock to something more complex, more subtle (listen to the drums <em>e.g.</em>). One's under the impression Kele is trying all sorts of new tricks and effects, and they sound good.</p>

<p>It is an album to listen to. As much as <em>Silent Alarm</em> was a surprise, <em>A Weekend in the City</em> is an experience. There's much more room to breathe. It expands. There's space. The band has metamorphosed into another dimension, and it suits them. It definitively suits me.</p>
