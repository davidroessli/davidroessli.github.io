Well, 2 days after Jobs' keynote, we got a chance to test the new software, and dwell on Apple's new directions.



The new hardware is good looking, especially the <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index12.html">12" PB</a>. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index17.html">17" PB</a> looks a little oversized at first - as on hormones - eventhough the screen looks terrific. Need to see the real thing. Did you notice that it is only 160 x 124 pixels short of Apple's 22" Display ?



The new software, well .. I just love the <b><a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife</a></b> integration - can't wait to integrate stills into my movies, and apply the "<a href="http://www.apple.com/imovie/">Ken Burns</a>" effect. direct access to your iTunes and iPhoto library is a dream. Not to mention direct access iDVD to burn your slideshows or movies directly from iPhoto or iMovie ..



The app I downloaded immediately was Apple's new web browser: <b><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a></b>. Apparently, Apple said that Safari downloads accounted for 20% of all apple.com downloads on Tuesday .. over 300'000 downloads. Whoosh.

<!--more-->

Safari is based on <b>Konqueror</b>, and uses its rendering engine, namely KHTML (Ouch! Gecko was my favourite, and many pages are optimised for it..).



After two days of use, I must say that<ul><li><b>it is fast</b>. I wouldn't say it is faster that Chimera (latest build), but it's a match.</li><li>The <b>UI is sleek</b>, inspired from iTunes. No wasted space with useless button or function, or deco. A border free browser. Sleek is the word.</li><li>Most of the sites I managed and visited showed up correctly. Even thoses using CSS2.  This is not the case for everyone. Checkout <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/07.html#safari_review">Dive Into Mark's report</a></li><li><b>SnapBack technology</b> needs to get use to, but I think it can serve its purpose when navigating in directory sites or online shops. A nice feature (still missing from Chimera) is the back button drop down menu (&#224; la IE).</li><li>The <b>bookmark management is out of this world</b>. I've never seen anything like it. That feature alone is almost worth safari's adoption. You have a direct access to your Address Book websites, and to the RendezVous websites near you (the latest Chimera seems to sport that feature too) - but I didn't manage to make it work yet .. </li><li>The <b>history management works extremely well</b> too - much better that Chimera for the time being (it's global here).</li><li>It includes a <b>keyboard shortcut for pop-up blocking</b> - Chimera misses that .. I love it.</li><li>Another great feature is the <b>activity window</b> that displays how much data was downloaded from where. Too cool.</li></ul>



On the downside,<ul><li> I'm missing <b>tab browsing</b> .. Gee, you get addicted to having mutiple sites in a single window.</li><li>The <b>view source</b> is also still very basic. It appears that there is an issue with the <b>screen resolution</b> adopted by Safari, which defaults to 72dpi, instead of the 96dpi of all other modern browsers (that brings us back to Netscape 4). hence, all text seem smaller on a Mac viewed with Safari. According to Todd Fahrner, the problems in the fact that Apple considers that 1point = 1 pixel, and Safari bases its default screen res on the default user font size.</li><li>Doesn't display the content of the TITLE parameter (anchor). <strike>I haven't found a way to know where a link will lead you since there's no status bar</strike> Use 'view status bar' under the view menu - you can actually turn on of off any button in the button bar like that .. Holding option down when the mouse is over a link downloads the link, and command opens the link in a new window.</li><li>No keychain support ?</li></ul>



But overall, I'm quite impressed. I'm sure the next released will fill up the gaps, and address the bugs. Implement tab browsing, and it'll become my main browser ..
