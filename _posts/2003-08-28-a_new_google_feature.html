<p>What's nice about coming back from a vacation is to discover all the new features and software releases that appeared while one was unplugged.</p>
<p>Google offers a cool one: a <a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html#calculator">calculator</a>. Just type an arithmetic expression in the search box and hit return. It can handle unit transformation (16.67 kilometers in yards), use universal constants (pi * mass of earth), or mix the lot (170 centimeters * pi in Calories).</p>
<p>Handy as a binary to hexadecimal converter .. especially from Safari's built-in Google search box:</p>
