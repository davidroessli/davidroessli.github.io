<p><em>Warning: the following notes were live blogged, so please forgive the typos and semantic errors, I'll brush it up later and break it up ion separate posts. Some day. Maybe.</em></p>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>The LIFT Experience sounds wild. Live photos, live hand blogging. Not so Empty Book, etc.</p>

<h3><a class="sidelist" href="http://www.liftconference.com/person/bruce-sterling" title="Bruce Sterling">Bruce Sterling</a></h3>

<p>The first I heard of Bruce Sterling last year's LIFT and was also at SxSW last year when he delivered his <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/blogs/podcasts.php/2007/03/14/bruce_sterling_s_sxsw_rant" title="Grab the podcast">brilliant 'SxSW rant'</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Short focused punchy way</strong>. That's the way is was, now get after it. future? Motivational. Moral boosting. The main reason people prosper, is because they get out of bed. Showing up. Persisting. That is what really counts. You are Europeans here. People who have some historical sense. 208 is not going to be a pivotal year. It's a crap year. Hard. Recession. China's olympics - nice, sweet, well.. India is doing great, but surrounded by crazy lunatics. Europe? Great, but slow. Like a Python. Slooow.</p>

<p>Global warming? A 200 years old problem. Not an issue. Our children's children will have the same problem. Technological? Is it fun to watch MS eat up Yahoo? MS is boring. Gates left it was so boring!! Gates would rather cure malaria rather than pretend MS is the road ahead…</p>

<p>Prophecy: how you can deal with phemoenon you are sure to be confronted to. Practical certainty you'll see it. More and more. If you do understand what is going on, you probably won't like it very much. But you'll cope. Madame Carla Sarkozy. First lady of France. First time they meat what at a tech conference.</p>

<p>Repress peer to peer networks on French soil. In a french way. Carla is a product of a technology internet romance. A black swann. Historical event, unpredictable. 9/11 was a black swann. Black swanns can be good as well as they can be bad. Digital renaissance.</p>

<p>Sarko has multipled his options dramatically. Carla capable of anything. Not a journalist in a world ciuldn't write Carla-Sarkosy a story. You are going to be swamped. It is simply the most interesting story there is.</p>

<p>How come? What really matters? Ambition and publicity. Carla's ambition (politicians are always ambnitious). They are notorious. Can't turn it off, but they can turn it on, feed the press. They have both done that, repeately. There is 2<sup>2</sup> ways of combining ambition and publicity.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Low ambition and low publicity: end in tears - 40%</li>
	<li>Low ambition and high publicity: first diva of France scenario - 15%</li>
	<li>High ambition and low publicity: power behind the throne scenario - 10%</li>
	<li>High ambition and high publicity: the weird scenario. Empress of Europe. Conquer the world - 35%</li>
</ol>

<p>They don't no the future any better than you. Failure is alway most likely. If they get away with this, crowds of politicians will be liberated to have the same personal lives. Evil. Bad for us.</p>

<p>In 2028 "Carla Bruni? That sounds so early 21th century". Internet was a black swann too. Internet doesn't need political favours.</p>

<p>90% of success: showing up. You survive to see it. You become the future. You live. You are it. That is how life is best enjoyed.</p>

<p class="update">Very <em>Bruce Sterling</em> like. Provocative, punchy, funny and pertinent. A verbosed and graphic <strike>talk</strike> rant. If showing up is 90% of success, there's hope.</p>


<h3><a class="sidelist" href="http://www.liftconference.com/person/pierre-bellanger" title="Pierre Bellanger">Pierre Bellanger</a></h3>

<p>Founder of french media group Skyrock. Largest weblog plateform in Europe. Started as a pirate broadcasting at the end of the 70ties. First radio for the 13-24. Very simple blogging plateforme to use. First French speaking network in the world (French represents 5% of worldwide users). 17th site in the world in pageviews - amazing to be in the first 20.</p>

<p>The world teenager social network aming to be the first site in the world. In order to grow, you need to constantly change. The netamorphosis.</p>

<p>The mother of all social networks: e-mail. Social nets are for e-mail what search is for the web. The blog becomes your new digital identity, as opposed to your e-mail address which doesn't give much info on your <em>per se</em>.</p>

<p>Center of electronic exchange: a lot of new teenager users don't use their e-mail anymore, but their profile for all their electronic exchange. <strong>The social net if the future of telecommunications</strong>. Skyrock has created a piece of software.</p>

<p>Value is shifting from network exploitation to software (applications). <strong>Bandwidth to programming code</strong>. Tomorrow's social network. Core.</p>

<p>Vision: the mobile phone is evolving to a poket size internet terminal. Physical and digital identities merge because they share the same physical location. Always together.</p>

<p>Instant messenger is the way - ideal interface: merge social net and IM. The crossroad of all exchanges. Don't bring the web to the phone. It sucks. The <strong>social messenger</strong> is the way</p>

<p>Access through a mobile device will become prevalent. Ubiquitous. Synch with friends. The device will provide info for you (location, what are you doing, etc.) you won't have to type it anymore. The device will be a true player.</p>

<p>Mobile device OS becomes a Social OS - an SOS? :) The small wins.</p>

<p>The telco companies will fight to control that OS, that social interface. Because that is where is value will be. Change provider in two clicks - more complicated (and dangerous) to change social networks.</p>

<p>Mobile cloud computing. Distributed computing. Each mobile device as powerful as a server. Collaborate and share bandwidth access between machines. Wireless mesh networks.</p>

<p>Each PC will be a terminal and a server at the same time. Terminal and distant software merge. PC and mobile software will merge too, and the mobile OS will dominate.</p>

<p>Access to spectrum. Open access to create that system. Compagnies can't let the telco control the spectrum. Look at Google's big to buy a wavelength. Battle for spectrum. Battle for code.</p>

<p><em>The world of social network is going to change</em>.</p>

<p class="update">I never thought Skyblog was as big as that, it is quite amazing. Most of what was presented makes sense, moreover with what Google, Apple and other are getting up to. Telco companies should start worrying and changing. Open up guys. Content and people are the real power. SkyRock will eat you a up.</p>

<h3><a class="sidelist" href="http://www.liftconference.com/person/jonathan-cabiria" title="Jonathan Cabiria">Jonathan Cabiria</a></h3>

<p>Permeability: real life + virtual life = one life. We have different identities. Why? What is the reason? Safety. Survival. Evolutionary. Communities: come together to be safe and evolve safely.</p>

<p>We need to feel connected. People get marginalised if their identity isn't liked. If people feel they don't quite belong they either rebel (extreme identity display - tattoo, piercing, speech), or they close in hide, become depressed. </p>

<p>By being in the virtual world, they were able to express those facets that were repressed. They became stronger. Self esteem got higher. Depression lifted. These good positive benefits transpired back into the real world.</p>

<p>Strange juxetaposition between the two worlds. Felt more real in the virtual life. more phoney in the real one. One participant asked why the two worlds were always put side by side. They are both part of the same world. One world. Life v1.0</p>

<p>Permability, transparence, exchanges. Think broader.</p>

<p class="update">This was a enjoyable talk fairly well delivered in a very professional way. I particulary liked the broader anthropological light he shed on the topic. Made a mental note to checkout his research.</p>


<h3><a class="sidelist" href="http://www.liftconference.com/person/younghee-jung" title="Younghee Jung">Younghee Jung</a></h3>

<p>Anthropologist at Nokia Tokyo. Telecommunications have been around for more than a century. How do you design for users? (Example: indian girl: one mobile phone, sole electronic device in home, layed on the altar because it is the only dry place in her home). Diversity.</p>

<p>Social aspects of mobile technology. What does it means to work people? Nokia Open Studio: design competition. Hosted in 3 communities: Mumbai, Rio and Accra (Buduburam). Recruited local teams in each location that understands local cultures.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mumbai: "Design a phone, win a phone"</li>
<li>Rio: "It's about time to design your own cellphone"</li>
<li>Buduburam: "Your dream phone: share it with the world"</li>
</ul>

<p>Challenges: weather, floods / crossfire, security / electricity, crowds.</p>

<p>Lasted for three weeks. Entry form (single A3 sheet). Studio visit to complete the form. Children brought parents, family, friends. Entry form was completed with an interview. Photoshoot. Everybody was given a printout. People went home to change into nicer clothes. Select a winner. Award ceremony.</p>

<p>They felt proud telling what they thought. Winners were selected.</p>

<ul>
<li>A women (not many participated) in Mumbai proposed a phone to simply point at the sky to check the weather;</li>
<li>Father religious in Rio proposed a phone that measures pollution and environmental problems to increase awareness;</li>
<li>Buduburam 21 yesr student proposed a phone that hosts up to 4 SIM card (multiple operator), waterproof, playstation and cable TV.</li>
</ul>

<p>Distinctive aspects in each community:</p>

<p>Mumbai. Loudspeaker to make announcements. Mango and heart shape phones. Symbol of love. Device symbolism.Phone always close to the heart. Bottle shape phone stores water and floats in water. Help in emergencies. A mobile phone that never falls from hand, and if it falls never breaks. Those ideas were wished by so many people. People keep mobile devices for long period of times.</p>

<p>Rio. Aware of community problems. Social worker. Leading young people in right direction: all entertainement systems in one device (incl. ful blwon pychologist). mother of 3 children. Phone that monitor her mum when away from home. Peace cell. Emit peace soundwaves to annihilate violence.</p>

<p>Buduburam. Solar charging cellphone and translate languages for people. people must gop to paying charging stations. Pen drive double function - long term memory. Civilian police - long term memory. Keep live pictures stored in phone to share later. Caller identification. Moon. If she can see the receivers picture, easier identification. Location of caller/receiver shown automatically. Can't lie when called. Unstable life situations. Prevent people from lying. Classic 192: 2 screens for local/international calls. Many depend on relatives abroad. Must not miss overseas calls. Global awreness.</p>

<p>What would you design for an indian girl? What did we lean through Open Studio?</p>

<p>Time limit. What can you learn in 2 weeks? It is short, but it will bring fresh aspects for designers. Seeking the relevance to technology to their lives. Subjective perceived value of technology. Cross reference with other street surveys and ethnographic research results.</p>

<p>Future? Hilight issue we tend to neglect?</p>

<p class="update">okay, here's Nokia's pitch to field work "we are listening to you" trend. I would beware of the stats of these kind of operations. Two short, too few people. Interesting <em>per se</em> but I'm not sure this is relevant beyond giving Nokia some kind of good conscience.</p>

<h3><a class="sidelist" href="http://www.liftconference.com/person/genevieve-bell" title="Genevieve Bell">Genevieve Bell</a></h3>

<p>Ethnology, anthropology. Works for Intel ("we're 30 working for Intel"). Find out how people use technology. Check out her book: "Secrets, lies and digital deceptions…" -- Genevieve Bell </p>

<p>The ways we use to protect our identities. Lost Flickr password. Lied on birthdate, location, etc. Most people (45%) lie on their location in the UK. A 100% people online lie (men about height, women about weight).</p>

<p>Arms race of digital deception. Emissions and admissions? What might an ethnographic approach help in better understanding these phenomenons.</p>

<p>Technology changes faster than people do. </p>

<p>Secrets and lies. Lies = untrue. Secrets = do not disclose, withold. In all cultures or religions there are situations, when not telling the truth is okay. "It is okay to say a 1000 lies if the wedding still happens", "white lies".</p>

<p>Secrets: keeping secrets = good. Make friends. Maintaining relationships.</p>

<p>Gap between what we say and what we do: we tell lies all the times (6-200 lies a day) 40% to conceal misbehaviour, 14% to keep their own social word ticking over, and 9% to increasing one's own popularity.</p>

<p>Men tell more lies than women. Secrets are kept and broken irrespective to religion, laws, etc.</p>

<p>Lies is a necessary part of life? It it not the opposite of truth. Part of human survival. Actively repress what is going on around you. Form of play. Work through what is appropriate or not.</p>

<p>All info should be available equally to all. Recent notion and concept. Secret and sacred. What appears to be in the public domain is already coded. Witholding info is a way of keeping it safe. What we choose to withold and why denotes what/how we choose to shape our own reality.</p>

<p>Digital deceptions. Lying about where, what, how, who you are (context, intent, identity). We are dissemble online. 10% of MySpace is over the edge of 100 years old (US laws require you to be &gt; 18yrs old). Lies protect private information.</p>

<p>Guilt, shame, worry in the real world don't transpire when lying in the virtual world. Denying realities. (postsecret.blogspot.com) Twitter is about making confabulation into art.</p>

<p>Cellphone have tracking services attached to them. Use of video camphones, lie detection algorithm on SMS/email (the more words you use, the bigger the lie). Alibi services to create whole back stories.</p>

<p>System and networks worry about privacy, people don't think that way. People tell lies to withold, change, reshape reality. Social networks ~ bedrock of confabulation? How do secret and lies offer new ways to think about all this.</p>

<p class="update">Another constructor's pitch. This one went doen better. Much more academic than the previous one, it unveiled original ideas and angles to the whole concept of "online privacy" in regard to previous studies on "real world privacy". Slides were too crowded. She would have benefited from simpler more illustrated slides. The last one reminded my Seth Godin's talk at GEL 2006: it was a superbe illustration of "something's broken". A road sign post stating "Don't trust your sat nav system, narrow road". Technology lies too.</p>

<h3><a class="sidelist" href="http://www.liftconference.com/person/paul-dourish" title="Paul Dourish">Paul Dourish</a></h3>

<p> University of California Irvine. Getting from here to there (ethnography, design, privacy, location). Misunderstanding about ethnographic results relevance to design.</p>

<p>Approach mbility from tech point of view: latitude, longitude, services, localise, mapping, etc. From an ethno point of view: home, colony, pilgrimages, asylum, migration, nomad, dispora, etc. - very different concepts. Symbolism++ on who we are, who we think who we are.</p>

<p>Space through which we move take a meaning, depending on personal experience, population structures, deeply grounded in questions of identity and belonging. Refugee status is a claim of ethnic status - the movement in different space that allows them to do that (form of categorical identity).</p>

<p>Morality of forms of presence and habitation. Exclusions. Ex. Parole sex offenders with GPS devices (abrogation of their civil rights to privacy). </p>

<p>Focus on the analytic contributions.</p>

<p class="update">As he pointed out, we were getting hungry by the time Paul arrived on stage - 30 minutes late. I had trouble diving into his speech and tended to float over it instead. Another academic approch to the ethnological/anthropological view of mobility. Superpose the online concepts with the real world one, and it gives you food for thought.</p>

<p>Back in the conference hall, had lunch, chatted with a couple of German guys about yesterday's workshops, eve dropped on the TSR crew's views of the event, and had my photo taken. Bruno Guissani is moderating this session "Stories".</p>

<h3><a class="sidelist" href="http://www.liftconference.com/person/rafi-haladjian" title="Rafi Haladjian">Rafi Haladjian</a></h3>

<p>Remember the Minitel? Rafi was involved in its development and founded Violet and invented the Nabaztag. Sweet.</p>

<p>Lets get to meatspace. Calm technologies. Bandwidth of attention is critical. People have small amount of attention. More things on a screen is not a solution. Ambiant lighting? Spray info in the air? Reaction of things?</p>

<p>Moore's law and natural evolution. In the beginning, chips were expensive, etc. smaller, cheaper, PC, etc. now we can embed them everywhere. 1 user w/several computers.</p>

<p>Something was happening in the rest of the industry. Why do teddybears sing? bathroom scales moved from analog to digital. All makers have this problem: obsolescence of what they do. Chips everywhere. Just for the sake of innovating. Yeah.</p>

<p>Soon, we'll have communicating versions of all these objects: wifi bathroom scale. DRM teddybears anytime soon?</p>

<p>Domotics, interaction homes, but it never happened. Why? Not appealing. Sucks. No fun. not sexy. Price tag sucks. Too much effort. Proprietary technologies. Strangers in their own home.</p>

<p>One day, okay. But how do we get there? From the Flitstones to the Jetstones. Stop doing cheap stuff, but affordable, don't make it too useful = boring. Include fun factors and features that interact with other people. Keep it simple with open standards. Expand the internet to object. Put the user in the middle and empower him. Don't think you can do everything. Open it up to the world. Build a community.</p>

<p>DAL Lamp: 1st internet connected lamp. Changed colour with traffic info, etc. turned red when an email left with the word "love" in it. Here came the Nabaztag in 2005, and the Nabaztag/tag in 2006</p>

<p>Why a rabbit? If you can connect a rabbit, you can connect anything. It was random, really. The idea was to show that you can <em>even</em> connect rabit, not to connect rabbits. There is a life after the PC.</p>

<p>Ambiant Informstion Device. Nabaztag is good at things that are "good to know" but not worth the effort.</p>

<p>Nabaztag + Galimard Jeunesse: children book with RFID tag. Show the book to the rabbit, and the rabbit starts reading the book. Bookmarks. Pause, forward, backward.</p>

<p>Exploring new way in which objects don't have to disappear to exist in an interactive form. Use the book as a book which becomes interactive. Network building in the next version, choose your voice, share with friends.</p>

<p>Ztamps: use of RFID tags and stick them on everyday objects and select triggers and actions.</p>

<p>Let things be connected. First connect rabbit, second connect everything else.</p>

<p><em>Check out the book called "Material World"</em></p>



<h3><a class="sidelist" href="http://www.liftconference.com/person/eric-favre" title="Eric Favre">Eric Favre</a></h3>

<p>Nespresso co-inventor. Passion. Talk in French. On stage with his wife. History of the Nespresso capsule (1976) and foundation of the Nespresso S.A. company (1985). Monodor.</p>

<p>The idea came from a misuse of an industrial coffee machine: foam = air + water + coffee oil.</p>

<p>The N of Nespresso is born through the desire of seducing the women who found this virile product appealing (two high heel shoes).</p>

<p>Monodor patent: 15 years, 30 countries, â‚¬ 400'000.</p>

<p>Nespresso represents approximatively 1% coffee drinks in the world. Aims 20% soon. Out with the aluminum, in with polypropylène.</p>

<p>TPresso: 15 years of research, will be launched this year. Tea in capsules. Tea from Chamong, Darjeeling.</p>


<h3><a class="sidelist" href="http://www.liftconference.com/person/jasmina-tesanovic" title="Jasmina Tesanovic">Jasmina Tesanovic</a></h3>

<p> Feminist, political activist, translator, publisher and filmmaker gave a presentation about blogging, genders and politics exemplified by Balkan examples.</p>

<p>Starting blogging before the name was coined. <a href="http://blog.b92.net/arhiva/blog/22">B92 blogging</a> opened in 2006. In Serbia only 30% have access to internet. Blogger about war crimes.</p>


<p><em>Open stage</em></p>
<p>(more later)</p>


<h3>Marc Laperrouza</h3>

<p>China. The future of telco is in China. 1st time that a tech is more used in developping countries than in developped countries.</p>

<p>2.5 billion users in the world or which 59% in developping countries. 500 million in past 12 months, 25% growth in China and India. More phone in developping countries than in western countries.</p>

<p>Diversity in Asia. Penetration of mobile will outstrip that of computers. 5-6 million new customers per month.</p>

<p>War of standards. China developped their own standard: TD-SCDMA. The state is never far away from technology deveoopment.</p>

<p>Innovative usage: crowd shopping. 500 people gather to negociate a discount on the spot. Colour coding content of text messages according to nature of content. Super Girl when critical mass become critila masses (voting isn't something people do in China).</p>

<p>The future of mobile telephony is in the countryside. Mobile communications means different things to differents people.</p>


<h3>Heewon Kim</h3>

<p>How teenagers interact with social software in Southern Corea. Broadband penetration amounts to 26% (almost all households). Average of 47.2 hrs/month online.</p>

<p>Minihompy</p>

<p><em>Having trouble sustaining the blogging.</em></p>


<h3>Gen Kanai</h3>

<p>Mozilla. 10 years old this year. Global effort to promote choice. Firefox represents 23% marketshare in Switzerland. </p>

<p>Japan has more mobile internet users than PC users. Corea was so far ahead in terms of internet access, the Corean government developped their own encryption algorithms, and so if you want to develop secure applications, you must use Windows ad IE.</p>

<p>Open source in Asia. Are Asian contributing to open source? Barriers to participation. Culture, language, education. Linus feels the culture is the strongest, but no one knows why. (what about Ruby?)</p>

<p>Bhutan developped their own OS (Debian) after MS refusing to port Windows to Bhutan.</p>

<p>Cultural barriers: differences in how people participate in projects. Direct confrontation, criticism is natural in the West, but less in Asia.</p>

<p>Language is a huge barrier. De facto language in OSS is English.</p>

<p>Economics. Cannot choose type of technologies they use, or projects they work on. In the West, a typical OSS developper has a day job, and works on OSS in the evening.</p>

<p>Western conceots such as meritocracy are not necessarily understood in Asia.</p>


<p>LIFT going to South Corea in September 2008</p>
