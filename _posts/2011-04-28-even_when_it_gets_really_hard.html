<p>I've just finished reading <a href="http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies" title="Merlin Mann on Twitter" class="sidelist">Merlin Mann</a>'s <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2011/04/22/cranking" title="«Cranking»" class="sidelist">«Cranking» entry</a> posted on <a href="http://www.43folders.com/" title="43 Folders" class="sidelist">43 Folders</a> and feel deeply moved by the emotions it conveys.

<p>Merlin has such a way with words. The real life images he depicts in his post are somehow hardwired to my memories, and trigger strong emotional responses.</p>

<ul class="disc">
<li>Especially if you are a <strong>dad</strong> and you love your dad;</li>
<li>Especially if you do what you do because you <strong>love</strong> what you do;</li>
<li>And more so if you are <strong>self</strong> employed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you Merlin for sharing those moments with us, for finding the right words that express what a lot of us feel and experience and love and wish for.</p>

<p>I would have loved writing something like that.</p>
