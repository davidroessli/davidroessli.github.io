<p>Well, believe it or not, this afternoon at 16:15 CET Intego publishes a <a href="http://www.intego.com/news/pr40.html">press release</a> announcing the launch of a Mac OS X Trojan Horse, just after my copy of VirusBarrier popped up with this alert around 15:50 CET:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:360px;">
<a href="http://www.macinblog.com/img/VirusBarrier Alert_shot002_1.jpg" onclick="window.open('http://www.macinblog.com/img/VirusBarrier_Alert_MP3Virus.jpg','popup','width=557,height=234,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/VirusBarrier_Alert_MP3Virus-tm.jpg" height="142" width="355" alt="VirusBarrier_Alert_MP3Virus-tm" /></a>
</div>

<p>My definitions were updated this morning by NetUpdate adding the ability to detect MP3 Concept.</p>
<p>I immediately checked the net for more in fo, but was unable to find anything before this evening. But when I write these lines, the CIAC, McAfee, Sophos or Symantec don't mention it. Even Google didn't turn up anything..</p>
<p><a href="http://www.macnn.com/news/24162">MacNN</a> and <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/08/1922237&#38;mode=thread&#38;tid=126&#38;tid=172">Slashdot</a> have a post, but the info remains sparse and unconfirmed.</p>
<p>The alert was triggered when I launched BBEdit, and was reproducable once eventhough I clicked 'Repair' on the VirusBarrier alert dialog box. No MP3 files in my case..</p>
<p>Here's a copy of the e-mail alert:</p>

<p>It's actually the first time I've seen it work<br />:/</p>
