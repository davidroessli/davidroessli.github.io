<p>Steve Jobs launched Apple's new music service the "iTunes Music Store" which will allow you to download music for USD 0.99 a song (128Kbps AAC format). The store is accessed through <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes 4</a> in the same way you browse your own Library. 30 seconds free preview, cover art are among the features. The store holds some 200K songs, with <b>unlimited CD burning</b> for personal use.<br />
<br />
As an effort to prevent piracy, you must change your playlist every 10 burns (?) and you may share your music with a maximum of 3 other Macs (at one time). Not a word on the software used to monitor all this.<br />
<br />
Share your playlists, <b>stream your music from one Mac to another</b> (remember <a href="http://www.idees.ch/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=2&amp;search=icommune">iCommune</a> ?), although copying is not supported.</p
<p align="center"><b>This service not available if your billing address is non-US</b></p>
<p>Jobs also introduced a bunch of new cool <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPods</a> (10 to 30Gb, revamped UI, FW port underneath, cradle and direct access buttons) - available as from Friday.</p>
