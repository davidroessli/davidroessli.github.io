<p><a href="http://www.macnn.com/news/19265">MacNN</a>  reports that <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bb/daily/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1874807">Billboard</a> has published details on Apple's Music Service to be  anounced on Monday April 28th(<a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/030424/sfth027_1.html">live broadcast details</a>).
<blockquote><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_left.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /> Label sources tell Bulletin that the service is an a la carte download store -- not unlike that of rival Liquid Audio -- that is built into Apple's iTunes player. No subscription is required for the service, and <b>tracks are expected to retail for an average of 99 cents</b>. Once purchased, tracks are transferred to the consumer's iTunes music library and are automatically synched to the user's iPod portable player. <br />
<br />
<b>Content can also be burned to CD</b>. Credit-card information is stored on file in the store's shopping-cart system so the consumer does not have to re-enter the information for each purchase. <b>The offering is expected to be made available initially only to users of Apple computers</b>.  <img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_right.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /></blockquote></p>
