<p>While randomly browsing my <a class="sidelist" href="http://twitter.com/brainpicker/status/102560077684293632" title="Tweet by Maria Popova @brainpicker">Sunday feeds</a>, I rediscovered Erin Hanson's brilliant «<a href="http://recoveringlazyholic.com/needtowant.html" title="NEED TO WANT LESS">NEED TO WANT LESS</a>» set of relevant visual philosophical statements.</p>
