  <p>I almost never shutdown my MacBook Pro, I always send it to sleep. Faster wake up time, this behaviour makes sense on a laptop. Only, it can take ages for the MacBook to actually go to sleep. Check how long it takes between the moment you close the lip, and the power led start pulsing. <strong>Ages</strong>.</p>

<p>I've been meaning to blog about <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.jinx.de/SmartSleep.html" title="SmartSleep Preference Pane">SmartSleep</a> ever since <a class="sidelist" href="http://twitter.com/roessli/status/1099129942" title="I twittered it">I discovered it early this year</a>.</p>

<p>I almost never shutdown my MacBook Pro, I always send it to sleep. Faster wake up time, this behaviour makes sense on a laptop. Only, it can take ages for the MacBook to actually go to sleep. Check how long it takes between the moment you close the lip, and the power led start pulsing. <strong>Ages</strong>.</p>

<p>This is because your are not only sending your computer to sleep, but into hibernation too, which is the default behaviour. Sleep is fast, it is the hibernation which takes time as it is saving the MacBook's state on disk. So how can we change that? This is where SmartSleep kicks in.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jinx.de/SmartSleep.html" title="SmartSleep Preference Pane">SmartSleep</a> is a preference pane that dynamically sets the sleep state of your machine.</p>

<p>SmartSleep letâ€™s you select each select sleep state. Additionaly the new SmartSleep state lets your notebook just sleep while the battery has a high level. If the battery level drops below a certain point (default is less then 20% or 20 minutes) it will switch to sleep and hibernate. So you have the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>This preference pane runs flawlessly, to a point you forget it's installed - until you start working on a MacBook that doesn't have it.</p>

<p>A must have if you own a MacBook.</p>
