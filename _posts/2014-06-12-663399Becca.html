<p><time datetime="">Today</time>, <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/09/in-memoriam-2/">Rebecca Alison Meyer</a> will be buried after fighting a fight no one could win against cancer. <a href="https://twitter.com/meyerweb/status/475423495178838016">She was six years old to the day</a>.</p>

<p>It feels so unnatural for a child to die before his or her parents. I can't imagine a more devastating experience that a parent can face. Missing the child never goes away. A piece of yourself is lost and the future is forever changed.</p>

<p>To celebrate Rebecca, <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrobin140s/status/476109575532601344">Matt Robin</a> came up with the idea : “let’s get #663399Becca trending for Thursday 12th.” So, that's why my Twitter avatar is purple (<code>#663399</code>).</p>
