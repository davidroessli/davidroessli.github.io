Apparently, <a href="http://www.apple.com/airport/">AirPort Extreme</a> (802.11g), the new technology Apple introduced during MWSF 03, <b>will not be available in Switzerland</b> due to certification problems by the Swiss certification authority Bakom, according to an <a href="http://www.infoweek.ch/news/n_single.cfm?ID=6549">InfoWeek report</a> . It is not known when AirPort Extreme will be approved and sold by Apple Switzerland.

Oops. and what happens to the new PBs Airport Extreme ready? I don't think they accept the former Airport cards (802.11b) .. With a bit of luck, it might just be the same kind of delay France suffered from when the initial Airport technology was introduced.
