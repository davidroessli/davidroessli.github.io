<p>My operating system is playing up on me today. They are days like that, when little things go wrong, apps quit, settings disappear - one feels a little out-of-sync, ones OS a little unreliable, unstable - and one doesn't really know why.</p>

<p>It reminds me of a paper I read on Dr Dobbs last year entitled "<a href="http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=7453/ddj0208q/0208q.htm">What scruft is</a>". Unfortunately, I can't find it anymore .. Basically, scruft is what accumulates over time in your computer, slowing it down, making it less reliable and unstable, until you break down and perform a complete OS reinstall.</p>

<p>Mark from <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">diveintomark.org</a> experienced just that this summer, and posted a paper on "<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/08/04/xp">How to reinstall XP in 5 hours or less</a>".</p>

<p>Instructive.</p>
