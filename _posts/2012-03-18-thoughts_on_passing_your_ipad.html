<p>Each time I've upgraded to a new <em>iDevice</em>, the previous one was passed down to a family member. This has worked out just fine, until now - maybe.</p>

<h3>Backup is key</h3>
<p>Make sure to backup your iPad to iCloud or to your computer (faster restore) prior to resetting it for its next owner. The iCloud restore works fine, but take longer. Your settings and data are restored as fast as your internet connection permits, but the apps are restored from the iTunes App Server, which can take a long time, especially if you have a lot of installed applications.</p>

<p>I switch to iTunes backup just before upgrading, as the restore is much faster. Once completed, I switch iCloud backup back on.</p>

<h3>Apple ID</h3>
<p>I'm having a few thoughts on how Apple associates the device to your <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.apple.com/support/appleid/" title="Apple ID Support">Apple ID</a> since the introduction of iCloud last October:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4627">
<p class="quote">When you turn on Automatic Downloads or download past purchases on an iOS device or computer, your device or computer will be associated with your Apple ID. Your Apple ID can have up to 10 devices and computers (combined) associated with it.</p>
<p class="source"><a class="sidelist" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4627" title="Associating a device or computer to your Apple ID">support.apple.com/kb/HT4627</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We're talking about the Apple ID used to purchase items from the iTunes Store, right? Not the iCloud Apple ID linked to your personal data?</p>

<p>If so, the way to go forward is to have a personal Apple ID for your iCloud data (mail, calendars, contacts, etc.) and another for your iTunes purchases. <a class="sidelist" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4895" title="Apple IDs and iCloud">Apple supports this approach</a>.</p>

<p>This is fine. But what happens when you reset your iPhone of iPad and sell it, or as in my case, hand it down to another family member? <strong>Will the device still be associated with its previous Apple ID for 90 days?</strong></p>

<p>This is okay if the person uses the same Apple ID for purchases, but if you've sold it to a friend, or on eBay? What happens when there is a change of owner?</p>

<p><strong>Removing a device from your Apple ID does not override the 90 day timer</strong>. But does a full reset override it?</p>

<p>Has anybody run into similar issues? Or am I getting this whole thing wrong?</p>
