<p>MacMice have done it again. When I received my iSight back in July, I ordered a <a href="http://www.macmice.com/sightclips.html">SightClip</a> for my Studio Display (who actually <strong>stuck</strong> Apple's stand on their monitor?). Months later, they released the <a href="http://www.macmice.com/sightflex.html">SightFlex</a>, a cool flexible stand for your favourite cam, enabling you to position it exactly where you want, including next to your iChat window!</p> 

<p>Now they've announced <a href="http://www.macmice.com/iflex.html">iFlex</a>, the same model, but for iBook/PowerBook owners. Scheduled for release on Jan 8th, just in time for MWSF.</p>
