<p><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/NetNewsWireLite_favicon.jpg" height="321" width="322" align="left" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="0" />After Safari, here come the favicons in <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>. The application searches for the favicon file (favicon.ico) in the same directory than the RSS feed. It doesn't read the x-icon meta tag (yet).</p>
<p>So if you want your icon to show up, make sure it's located at the root of the feed, or add it to your  ~/Application Support/NetNewsWire/Favicons/ folder (name it: site_domain_tld.ico as in www_macinblog_com.ico).</p>
