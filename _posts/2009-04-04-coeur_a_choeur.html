<p>Last night I discovered the Chorale des Bains' new show named í¢â‚¬Å“Choeur íƒÂ  Coeurí¢â‚¬Â at <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.mqpaquis.ch/" title="La Traverse, Maison de QUartier des Paquis">La Traverse</a> in the Paquis.</p> 

<p>So much more than a traditional choir, the Chorale des Bains delivers a full fledge show, tied up in a neat choreography, full of surprises and good ideas. </p>

<p>You are lead by the hand through their passion for populars songs, discovering their connivance with their choir leader, laughing and smiling throughout the performance. Set after set, costumes change, new accessories appear and the stage balance changes. There isn't a dull moment.</p>

<p>The show is rich, dynamic, high in colours, funny and delicately layed out with all the necessary ingredients for you to spend an enjoyable moment. You won't regret it.</p>

<p>Hurry up and book a seat, it ends tomorrow (Sunday 5 April 2009).</p>

<p>On a more personal level, yesterday was the first time we left the children babysit themselves. Time is going by at an astonished speed lately. Mathias and Emma are growing up fast, and I am having more and more trouble retaining the sands of time from trickling through my closed fingersí¢â‚¬Â¦</p>
