  <p>March is back with its birthdays and memories.</p>
  <p>We organised Emma's first birthday party on Wednesday, after having spent the previous evening blowing up helium balloons and decorating - and remembering what we were doing - thinking - feeling 3 years before. It's surprising how much one can remember - especially the details. I can recall the exact positions we were occuping on the couches, what we watched on TV (Jackie Brown), at what time we went to bed - what we were reading at the time.. and the sequence of events that followed the next morning.</p>

<p>March is back with its birthdays and memories.</p>
<p>We organised Emma's first birthday party on Wednesday, after having spent the previous evening blowing up helium balloons and decorating - and remembering what we were doing - thinking - feeling 3 years before. It's surprising how much one can remember - especially the details. I can recall the exact positions we were occuping on the couches, what we watched on TV (Jackie Brown), at what time we went to bed - what we were reading at the time.. and the sequence of events that followed the next morning.</p>
<p>The next event is Mathias' birthday party on Wednesday with his little pals. It'll probably be more eventful as only boys are invited ;)</p>
<p>This weblog has been very quite for the last few weeks. A lot of things have since the last post.</p>
<ul>
<li>My ADSL lines have successfully been upgraded to 1200/200 - with other problems arising, such as defective DNSs, network problems, etc.</li>
<li>Our February holidays were a great success, flying by far too quickly. I still have to sort, edit and print the photos/DVDs.</li>
<li>Busy is not the word. Projects starting all over the place, fresh ideas, new collaborations, XHTML/CSS rules!</li>
<li>Snow, cold, sun, spring, and back to winter. Rain.</li>
<li>Original Batman series on Wed@6:00p</li>
<li>New travel novel</li>
</ul>
