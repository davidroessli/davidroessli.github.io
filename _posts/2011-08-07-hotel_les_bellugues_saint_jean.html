<p>Sometimes things fall just right.</p>

<p>We are back from our <a class="sidelist" title="Pictures of our trip on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davo39/sets/72157627220603047/">short trip in the Cévennes</a> relaxed and rested thanks in part to the warm welcome we received from Pascal and Yves who run the charming <a href="http://www.hotel-bellugues.com/" title="Hí´tel Les Bellugues " class="sidelist">Hí´tel Les Bellugues</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Jean-du-Gard" title="Saint Jean-du-Gard" class="sidelist">Saint Jean-du-Gard</a>.</p>

<div class="pix right nosh"><a class="sidetitle" title="Visit Hotel «Les Bellugues» on Gowalla" href="http://gowal.la/s/FegG"><img src="http://static.gowalla.com/categories/92-15ede6102c97b9cea1e333c098253f20-100.png?1" /></a></div>

<p>The hotel exists for a number of years now, and is well known in the hikers circles as a compulsory stop in that region. Pascal and Yves were leading busy lives in Paris, and longed for a change of life when they discovered the hotel was up for sale. After thinking it over, they took the jump and finalised the deal at the beginning of the summer. We were among their first clients.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hotel-bellugues.com/">Hí´tel «Les Bellugues»</a> is an old filature situated in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Hotel+Les+Bellugues,+Rue+Pellet+de+la+Loz%C3%A8re,+Saint-Jean-du-Gard,+France&hl=en&ie=UTF8&ll=44.105646,3.883581&spn=0.018982,0.03253&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=42.716829,66.621094&z=15" class="sidelist" title="View location on Google Maps">center of Saint Jean-du-Gard</a>, a elongated building hosting around 16 rooms in a quite surrounding with a lovely garden featuring a swimming pool.</p>

<p>We chose to stay there for several reasons, one of which was the short length of our stay and the other the close proximity to one of our favourite river bathing spots of the area: the Gardon near the Pont des Abarines, sometimes known as le Mialet du Gardon.</p>

<p>The river runs through a gorge flaked with large granite blocks of all shapes and sizes, carved over time with the running water. The perfect spot to picnic, relax and unplug.</p>

<p>Even though at first the <a href="http://twitter.com/roessli/status/95520381976326146">weather conditions weren't stellar</a>, we had a very pleasant stay, despite the unpredictable rain downfalls and the low temperatures for the season. «Du jamais vu» according to the locals.</p>
