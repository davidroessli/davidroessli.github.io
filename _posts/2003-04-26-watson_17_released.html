excerpt: |-
  Remember the days before Sherlock 3? There was this little app called <a href="http://www.karelia.com/watson/">Watson</a> that let you browse the web in a single window.<br />
  <br />The release of Sherlock 3 overshadowed Watson by providing most of its functionalities. Now, Watson is back on the edge offering Sherlock's 2 search functionality  in the name of "SiteSearch". It also knows how to use the old Sherlock 2 plugins.

I must admit that I never really gave it fair trial - by lack of time I guess. This time, I intend to use it on a daily basis, it will complements nicely my RSS tool (<a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire Lite</a>). The <a href="http://rss.karelia.com/">Karelia weblog RSS feed</a> is available for those who wish to follow Watson's development.<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.usercreations.com/spring/3waybundle/">Beyond the Browser Bundle</a> offers Watson, Spring and NetNewsWire for USD 68 (25% off).
