How about a <b>shared calendar that <a href="http://www.apple.com/ical/">iCal</a> can subscribe to, and all users whatever their operating system can add items to from a Web interface ?</b>

Sounds groovy, no ? Okay, iCal can <b>only view it</b>, but it can come in handy.

The actual calendar is stored in a MySQL database, and the actual iCal is dynamically generated on the fly. This solution requires access to a web server, <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.org/">MySQL</a>.
