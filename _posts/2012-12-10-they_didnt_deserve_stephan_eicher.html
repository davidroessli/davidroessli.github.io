<p>«La vie est courte et compliquíƒÂ©eí¢â‚¬Â (<em>Life is short and complicated</em>) confessed swiss rock singer <a href="http://www.stephaneicher.com" title="Stephan Eicher" class="sidelist">Stephan Eicher</a> last night in <a href="http://www.thonex.ch/culture/agenda/article/stephan-eicher/">ThíƒÂ´nex</a>.</p>

<p>As many of us yesterday, I go back a long time with regards to Stephan Eicher, as far back as «les filles du limmatquaií¢â‚¬Â in 1983 - gasp. No one is getting any younger, but some of us have certainly grown old. I'll be damned.</p>

<p><strong>I have never experienced such a lame crowd at at rock &amp; roll gig as last night's</strong>. Gee. As if they'd all lost their soul somewhere on the way. Few were smiling, none were dancing, let alone jumping or singing. But they were all politically-correctly-well-behaved, clapping when they should, etc. But hey, they were <strong>BORING</strong>.</p>

<p>There were those who couldn't keep their gob shut, and couldn't help to to offer everyone around a running commentary of stupid empty minded remarks on what was going on <strong>WHO CARES?</strong> Just shut up and enjoy the show!</p>

<p>Then there were those who can't stand being in a crowd and defend their 50cm2 with acid remarks and violent elbow kicks. Hey guys, this is a <strong>ROCK &amp; ROLL</strong> gig, expect people to express what they feel by dancing, singing and jumping (and making their way to the front of the stage to share it with the band).</p>

<p>This said, <strong>the gig was great</stronG>. Stephan Eicher delivered a superb show, well rythmed and full of emotions, but sadly wasted on a bunch a creepy Sunday afternoon ninnies in their slippers. <em>Makes me sick</em>.</p>

<p>Where's the sharing, community, in trance feeling gone? I really had the impression people were consuming the event, not living it. It must be really hard for the bandí¢â‚¬Â¦</p>

<blockquote class="line">Dear Stephan,<br />I enjoyed your energy and positive outlook last night.<br />The flame still burns in some of us.<br />Let the others rust away. Cheers mate.</blockquote>
