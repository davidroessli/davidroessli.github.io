You're not going to believe this. While checking my main RSS feeds to get updated on the <a href="http://www.davo39.org/archives/000243.php">worldwide rallies against the war in Irak</a>, I stumbled on an incredible little gem called <a href="http://kmirror.deskmod.com/">Konfabulator</a>,<blockquote><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_left.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /> Konfabulator is a JavaScript runtime engine for Mac OS X that lets you run little files called Widgets that can do pretty much whatever you want them to.

Give it a try. The application was launched on Monday with a dozen widgets. Six days later, the <a href="http://kmirror.deskmod.com/gallery/">Gallery</a> offers about 50 different widgets that check your network bandwidth usage, display the latest VersionTracker headline, pings your website or watch your auctions on eBay.

The graphics are amazing as they take full advantage or Quartz. The widgets blend fluidly into your desktop with sliding and fading effects - stunning.

Next step: brush my JavaScript up and start writing my own..
