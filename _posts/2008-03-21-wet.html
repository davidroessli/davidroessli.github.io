<p>I don't know about you, but here you are better off staying at home, snuggling up in front of a warm chimney (if you have one - wish I did), listening to the wind blowing and the rain falling outside. <strong>Errrk</strong>. Where are my blue skies?</p>

<p>On the other hand, it's a perfect day to swap my <abbr title="MacBook Pro">MBP</abbr> internal drive.</p>

<p class="update">Naah. Not today. Need a 10mm T6 Torx screwdriverâ€¦</p>
