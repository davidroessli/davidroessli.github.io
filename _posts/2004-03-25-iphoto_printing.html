<p> Photo and Album Printing have been activated in iPhoto for (most) European users.</p>
<p>These features allows you to print your pictures and photo albums. I'll let you know how good they are as soon as I received my prints and albums. </p>
<p>The price in Switzerland is quite competitive (CHF 0.55 for a 10x15cm) - let's wait to evaluate the delivery times and quality.</p>
<p>iTMS where are you ..?</p>
