<p>Just a few lines before the day comes to a close to send you all my good vibes.</p>

<p>I am sure the months ahead will reveal to be a turning point to brighter horizons.</p>

<p>It might seem all uphill for the time being, but don't focus on that, focus on what you feel deep inside and what lays ahead. You're not alone.</p>

<p>Happy birthday James!</p>
