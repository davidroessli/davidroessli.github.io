<p>Here's music to start your week with: <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.naive.fr/sites/asa/?lang=en" title="Asa on Naí¯ve">Asa</a>'s (pronounce <em>Asha</em> which means <em>eagle</em> in Nigerian) self named debut album. An album full bright colours, heights and perspective. Rythms that callback long gone memories of Jamaican evenings, rythm &amp; blues, soul trips. She as an unique raspy voice, that wraps around you and radiates an amazing talent.</p>

<p>It reminded me of <a href="/logs/2007/02/ayo_joyful/" title="Ayo | Joyful">Ayo</a> in some ways, both born in Europe, they share origins that stem back to Nigeria, which comes through in their music. An addictive mix of reggae, jazz and soul. In other ways, Asa reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Chapman" title="Tracy Chapman on Wikipedia">Tracy Chapman</a> back in the late 80'ties with her simple melodies and affecting lyrics. At the time, there were only a handful of artists performing such a style successfully.</p>

<p>Discover Asa through her label <a href="http://www.naive.fr/sites/asa/?lang=en" title="Asa on Naí¯ve">Naí¯ve</a>'s website, and read more about her life and views in an <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.newdawnwithfunmi.com/today.asp?topic=asa2008" title="Asa on New Dawn">interview she gave to Funmi Iyanda on New Dawn</a>. You can also find her on <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.myspace.com/asaofficial
