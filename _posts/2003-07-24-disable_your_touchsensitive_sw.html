title: Disable your touch-sensitive switch
date: '2003-07-24 10:43:52 +0200'
excerpt: My 17" Apple Studio Monitor has started to play up recently. The Display
  switch suddenly lights up, and the System Preference Panel pops up out of nowhere
  to the front of screen. Most annoying. I suspected an USB problem, but it seems
  it is linked to a harware problem that occured in the first generation of 17" (and
  Cubes) that where produced. The switch and cell need to be changed all together.

<p>Roaming around <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20030426085542345">MacOSXHints I found the tip</a> I was looking for. Back in Mac OS 9, you could disable the switch through the Control Panel. I thought that feature had disappeared in Mac OS X. Wrong. It is only hidden.</p>
<blockquote>Hold the <strong>shift and command keys</strong> while opening the Display panel, or pressing on the front button, and a hidden tab will appear with a checkbox to disable the switches.</blockquote>
