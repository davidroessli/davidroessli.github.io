<p>Nineteen is a cardinal number that is the sum of ten and nine and is a prime number, it's also one off twenty, but today it's the sum of the years we've shared together.</p>

<p>It feels so good to be part of each other's life, to bring up our children together and help develop into young adults (and to be amazed by them), to share thoughts, projects, dreams and daily chores -- that I don't see the time go by.</p>
<p>That Monday on that far away beach remains as fresh as today.</p>

<p>Thank you for being you ♥️ Happy anniversary!</p>
