Okay, I know .. I'm a real geek .. but I was itching to try this combination for a while now.. and as Apple isn't supporting other phones (yet) I switched to a T68i. (Why did Nokia give up local SyncML on their 6xxx serie anyway!?!)

<b>Firstly</b>, I worked on my Address Book. Made it into my primary contact source by importing all the records from Palm Desktop. Needless to say that it took a fair amount of time to clean the Address Book up, remove old entries, amend and complete current ones etc.

<b>Secondly</b>, I selected all the contacts I wanted to upload to the phone by adding them to a group called "Cell", and then loaded them all into the phone via iSync with success - first go. Okay, the Address Book got all messed up because I forgot to "<b>Reset all Devices</b>" before the sync, but I had a backup handy, and the previous state was easily restored.

I've got an operational phone now. Next I'll be attempting to sync the Palm, phone and Mac. I'll keep you posted.
