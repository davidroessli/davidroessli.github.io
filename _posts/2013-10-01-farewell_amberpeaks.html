<p>The <a href="http://www.amberpeaks.com">Amberpeaks</a> chalets were sold to a new owner at the end of September and their website was closed shortly after.</p>
<p>It's always sad to see a functional website close down, but I guess it's life. I was good for as long as it lasted.</p>

<p>Thanks for the ride! Farewell Amberpeaks.</p>
