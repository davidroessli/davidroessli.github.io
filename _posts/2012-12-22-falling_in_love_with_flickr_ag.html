<div class="pix full nosh"><img src="https://davidroessli.com/logs/assets/img/6a00d83455287c69e2011278fab0c228a4-800wi.jpg" alt="Flickr" title="Flickr" /></div>

<p>I joined <a href="http://flickr.com" class="sidelist" title="Flickr">Flickr</a> in March 2005. That was before the first <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/media_2005_conference.html">@media conference</a> (the best web conference ever), <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davo39/sets/666310/">Fab's 40th birthday</a>, my children were still little kids and cameraphone pics were really crap.</p>

<p>I remember wondering what I could put up there. So I started uploading pics first from my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_T68i">T68i</a> followed by my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Razr">Razor V3</a> thinking that would be a good place to share them. Quality was low, and I used to upload them by email. Flickr was still Flickr, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr">it hadn't been acquired by Yahoo! just yet</a>.</p>

<div class="pix full"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davo39/8203906/" class="sidelist" title="My first pic on Flickr"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/6/8203906_04c57e5d7f.jpg" alt="Blue will do" /></a></div>

<p>I never left the service since, renewing my Pro account every couple of years. I always believed it was the best photo sharing website out there, and I still do. It tended to become the place where I uploaded sets of photos from Aperture, or cross posted pics from Instagram. But it wasn't the first stop for my mobile pics anymore.</p>

<p>Until they <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2012/12/12/our-latest-flickr-iphone-app/" class="sidelist" title="Flickr's new iPhone app">released their latest iPhone app</a> earlier this month.</p>

<h3>What a gem!</h3>
<p>I immediately adopted it as my primary photo sharing mobile app. It is just what I've been dreaming of for the last 3 years. <strong>Fantastic</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm not going to review it here as it's been done extensively elsewhere (<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1138500/flickr_apps.html">1</a>)(<a href="http://farukat.es/journal/2012/12/676-love-and-dont-love-new-flickr">2</a>). Just try it out if you have done so yet, but I feel this will be a turning point in Flickr's position on the social photo sharing market. It bids well, very well.</p>

<p>And what's more? <a href="https://twitter.com/roessli/status/282388155355770880">Flickr is offering 3 months of Flickr Pro</a> to existing customers. Merry Flickr!</p>
