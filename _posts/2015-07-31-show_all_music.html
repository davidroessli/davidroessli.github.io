<p>“Show All Music” has become “Show Music Available Offline” in the newly launched Apple Music, and I'm having trouble remembering where this setting is located (it must be my age…).</p>
<p>It used to be in the Music settings, but now it's located in the “My Music” sorting dropdown menu which defaults to “Artists”. I don't know if it's just me, but I don't expect to find a setting in a sorting menu, eventhough it makes kind of sense to put it there I guess.</p>
