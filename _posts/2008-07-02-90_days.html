<p>It's been almost 90 days since my last post.</p>
<p>Whoosh.</p>
<p>It's not like nothing happened, or that I haven't written anything, or felt, reflected, pondered or brainstormed. No. It's just that I haven't published anything.</p>
<p>I have a number of drafts in store. On ACLs, mobile websites design - turning into a white paper -, various rants, on my relationship with technology or with life in general, notes on the latest conferences I've attended, etc. There's food for thought enough. Just nothing public. Yet.</p>
<p>It's just that the basic publishing requirements weren't met. No enough time, quality time, intimate time.</p>
<p>Technology at home can be misinterpreted, misunderstood if not clearly explained and shared. Technology can appear as a barrier, a refuge, an exit. Truth is that technology can be used as a barrier, a refuge or an exit.</p>
<p>In my personal case, it is perceived as work invading the home. The moment I open my notepad, it is as if I left home for, well.. for another world. A private space.</p>
<p>Exclusion and frustration are derived from this behaviour. The paradox is that I take the upmost care not to interfere, perturb or invade the home activities. I usually lift the screen of my MBP when all are occupied, in bed,  when I feel that it won't be misunderstood, misinterpreted. But current reality denies me this right. Ironically, the uses I make of my computer these days is most of the time related to family life. It may be photo or video processing, family event scheduling, DVD authoring, etc.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I must admit that a great part of my life lays on or beyond the internet. E-mail, IM, Twitter, Flickr are only a few pipes that connect me to my friends, partners and clients. As a freelancer, I feel compelled to remain available, to monitor the websites I manage or to feed the social networks I belong to.</p>
<p>It is probably all a question of balance. Maybe part of me has been drawn outwards for various reasons, maybe my personal balance is at stake, maybe I don't communicate well enough, or maybe it's just life. I don't know.</p>
<p>The fact is I've been saying í‚« I don't know í‚» quite often recently, and my online presence has suffered from it. To tell you the truth, I don't really care. Wrong. I do care. Put it this way, I blog firstly for myself, for me. If the need, or the opportunity diminishes or evolves, well I deal with it. Or try to. As best I can.</p>
<p>This weblog, like those which came before, is just a mean for me to express certain views and emotions or share tips. I've never had the ambition of building a community or anything like that. So sometimes, I just stop publishing - 'pub' like in 'public'. I just get on with my life in the real world. If there's one thing I learned recently it's that <em>if you don't take it, nobody will give it to you</em>. Very egocentric, I know.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't know why I'm telling you all this, but thanks for reading all the same. Enjoy the summer. It's over 29í‚Â°C at 21:30CET. Bliss. I love it.</p>
