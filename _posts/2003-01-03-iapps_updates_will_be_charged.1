An <a href="http://rss.com.com/2100-1040-979129.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news">CNET article</a> suggests that Apple's 6 "i" apps will be charged for as from next week, eventhough they will still be bundled with each new Mac..

After last July's  .Mac's USD 100, here comes the iMovie, iTunes, etc. fees .. 

What's in store for Q2 2003 ? Software updates fees ? Restriced to .Mac members ? Brrr ..
