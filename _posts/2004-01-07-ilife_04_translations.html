<p>You probably watched <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/articles/2004/01/mwsf/">yesterday's Keynote</a>, so I won't comment on it or the new products/ services that were announced until I start to use them. Nevertheless, I was amused to discover how badly some product tag lines can be translated into French. The PowerBook 12"/17" &#171;Small is Big..&#187; one was terrible in French - meaningless actually. The iLife 04 is worse: it vehicles the <strong>wrong</strong> message:</p>

<p>The French translation found on <a href="http://www.apple.com/chfr/">Apple Switzerland's website</a> was removed and replaced by the English text earlier this morning. They must have warned that computer translated texts should be reviewed by a human being.. </p>
<p>The translation roughly goes like <em>&#171;As from now on, it's for life between Microsoft Office and you&#187;</em></p>

<p><strong>14:46 CET Update</strong>: here's the new version that has appeared on Apple France.</p>

<p><em>&#171;The Microsoft Office for your creative .. life&#187;</em></p>
