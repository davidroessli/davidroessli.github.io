<p>Dear Macinblog reader,<br />
<br />You might have noticed that this weblog has been rather quiet lately. I've been rather busy with the launch of two major projects late November and early December. But most of all, I've been thinkg about the reorganisation (reunification?) of my different weblogs under a common structure.</p>
<p>Macinblog turned 1 on Dec 3rd, and attracts a fair amount of regular followers which entices me to continue this low bandwidth newsletter. 2004 will see a new Macinblog integrated under my corporate website. My personal weblogs need to be unified too. I currently run <a href="http://www.davo39.org/">www.davo39.org</a>, and the former www.checkbox.org (MT) and <a href="http://wild.blogs.com/">wild.blogs.com</a> (TypePad - check the mobile pix section), and have photo galleries on .Mac (<a href="http://www.roessli.net/">www.roessli.net</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a> is a wonderful tool, and I recommended to anyone who doesn't want to be bothered with the installation of MovableType. <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">MT</a> on the other hand is my favourite weblog management system (WMS ?). It's extensibility is unique. I'll talk more about MT's uses on my new weblog next year.</p>
<p>All this to let you know that I haven't given up on you, but just stepped back to give all this a think, in order to address the future more efficently.</p>
<p>I wish you all a Merry Christmas, and send you all my best wishes for a happy, healthy and prosperous new year.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
