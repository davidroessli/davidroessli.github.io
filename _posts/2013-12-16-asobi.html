<p>It was a moment of pure delight, and amazement. The performance of the dancers was out of this world. Two men and three women played with their bodies amongst themselves, but also with the audience.</p>

<p>At times, you were faced with your own reflection - like a voyeur - watching playful seduction unfold only meters away.</p>

<p> At other times, you were witnessing unrelenting passion between two or more intermingled bodies which echoed deep inside.</p>

<p>I was profoundly touched by what Csaba Varga, Jann Gallois, Kaori Ito, Laura Neyskens and Peter Juhasz expressed and shared with us last night. They led us through a mosaic of intimate and sensual feelings, interrogations, doubts to abandonment. All our senses were awakened and sharpened.</p>

<p>At times, you could feel the texture of the garments, the scent of desire, connect to the obsession of the bodies. We were litterally part of the show last night.</p>
