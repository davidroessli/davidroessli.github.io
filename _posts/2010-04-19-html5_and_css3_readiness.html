<p>A cool visualisation of browser support per HTML5/CSS3 feature. Each browser is represented with a tile on the bar and gets an equal width of space, so if you see a bar that is full, that means that feature has universal support among all the 8 browsers (IE7-9, FF3.5-3.7, Opera, Safari 4, Chrome 4).</p>

<p>The site is coded using HTML5 and CSS3 tricks - try zooming with your mouse's scrollwheel (or ctrl-swiping).</p>
