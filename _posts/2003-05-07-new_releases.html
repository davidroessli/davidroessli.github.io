<p>Just picked up a couple of new releases on VersionTracker<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/index.html">DiskWarrior 3</a><br />
A killer app. The previous version saved my day on numerous occasion. Can't wait to get the upgrade. Fully Mac OS X compatible. Full versions can be downloaded, upgrades are shipped on CD (3 to 4 weeks backordered).<br />
<b>22:16 CET:</b> their secure server is currently overloaded - can't place my upgrade order, or download a full version. Victim of their popularity ?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eudora.com/betas/">Eudora 6</a><br />
This is also a longtime favourite of mine. I uses almost every version since 1.0. I finally gave it up when I switched to Mac OS X fulltime (10.1), and favoured Entourage until the Jaguar version of Mail - which I still use. Nevertheless, I still feel emotionally tied to Eudora which is a great product. This release might prove to be more Mac OS X mature, and certainly full of interesting features. such as spam fighting tools (opened to third party plug-ins), content concentrator, which gives you streamlined view of your email by sorting out the threads of replies, and mailbox drawers that are accessible from any mailbox window.</li>
</ul>
Enjoy..</p>
