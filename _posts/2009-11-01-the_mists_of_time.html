<p>I woke up this morning to find myself wrapped up in an old friend's arms: Mist.</p>

<p>There was something comforting about the way it dampened reality by overlaying a softness filter inside and out.</p>

<p>Focus was on my immediate and close needs. Preserving heat, stretching distal limbs, and bootstrapping my brain out of its haze into adagio mode.</p>

<p>The night's dew has dried up. Hello world.</p>
