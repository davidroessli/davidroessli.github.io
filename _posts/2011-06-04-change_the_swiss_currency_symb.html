<p>Mac OS X stubbornly displays the incorrect currency symbol for the Swiss franc: Fr. (or sFr. or SFr. depending on your OS version) instead of CHF which is the correct <a class="sidelist" title="ISO currency codes" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_widely_used_standards/widely_used_standards_other/currency_codes/currency_codes_list-1.htm">ISO symbol</a>.</p>
<p>This is a problem when invoicing applications rely on system settings to format your numbers. There is an easy fix: edit to your global preferences file to set it right. Unfortunately, it seems to reset periodically (through system updates maybe?).</p>
<p>So for memory, here is the command line to type in Terminal:</p>
<p><code>defaults write .GlobalPreferences AppleICUNumberSymbols -dict 0 '.' 1 '’' 10 '.' 17 '’' 8 'CHF '</code></p>
<p>Hopefully, this should be fixed in the upcoming Mac OS 10.7 (Lion).</p>
