<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gruber">John Gruber</a> has been recording his <a href="http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">podcast</a> live from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/"><abbr title="Apple Worldwide Developers Conference">WWDC</abbr></a> these last few years, and it's always a thrill to listen to it as he gathers extraordinary people around the subject of Apple tech.</p>
<p>This year was an epiphany: <a href="https://twitter.com/philshiller">Phil Shiller</a>, Apple Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing was invited on stage!</p>
<p>It turned out to be both funny and humane. Phil Shiller accepted to answer most questions with humour and sincerity. It was far from a fan-boy, PR driven interview. It was all about people, and their values -- and tech. And baseball. Great insight into Apple's culture shred by a Senior VP :)</p>
