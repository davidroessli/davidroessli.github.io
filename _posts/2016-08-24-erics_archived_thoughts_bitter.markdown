<p>Once again, <a class="sidelist" href="http://meyerweb.com" title="Eric Meyer's thoughts">Eric Meyer</a>'s words touch me deeply. His <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/08/23/bittersweet/"><time datetime="2016-08-23">latest entry</time></a> talks aboutÂ Joshua's first day of kindergarten, love and life.</p>
<blockquote>"Our kids may not understand exactly what we're saying in those moments, but they know exactly what we're talking about[...]"</blockquote>
<p>The moments and emotions Eric describes match closely those burned deep inside my own memory cells, eventhough I have not been through the ordeals him and his family have. He has a way with words that goes strait to my heart, and for a brief moment, we are completely aligned while I read his lines.</p>
<p>Thank you Eric for sharing your thoughts, may they be happy or sad, they are always true and deep, and inspire me in my own voyage through life.</p>
