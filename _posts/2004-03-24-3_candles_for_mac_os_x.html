<p>Mac OS 10.0 turns 3 today. It was launched on March, 24 2001, remember ? Seems ages ago, no?</p>
<p>After four major releases, Mac OS X has become as part of my every day life as Mac OS 9 was (and 8, and 7, and 6, ..). Moreover, this month sees the back of the last Classic application I couldn't do without (<a href="http://www.quartesoft.ch/">MacPay</a>). Its final Cocoa version is due out on March 26. I must admit that my <em>9</em> icon has been bouncing less and less in my Dock for the last 18 months now.</p>
<p><em>Wink: Emma turned 3 too in March ;)</em></p>
