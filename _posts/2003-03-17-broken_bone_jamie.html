<p>Poor old Jamie. We were all so sorry to hear what you endured on Saturday. The pain must be wicked. Try and rest, and I'm sure you'll bounce back in no time.</p>
<p>I quickly ran over to <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/">Amazon</a> to find a little something to make the time go by a little faster. I guess a book isn't the best of companions when you have a broken arm, but they say <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439994799/cybermediaconcep">this story</a> is really cool. You'll have to see with Mum for <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006LA7P/cybermediaconcep">this one</a> though .. Hope you enjoy them.</p>
<p><i>Hang on pal</i></p>
