<p>Winners of the <a class="sidelist" href="http://bestappever.com/" title="2008 Best App Ever Awards">2008 Best App Ever Awards</a> (according to <a href="http://www.148apps.com/" title="148apps.com">148apps.com</a> and their nomination committee) were announced at the <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.macworldexpo.com/" title="MacWorld Expo">2009 MacWorld Expo in San Francisco</a> on January 7th, 2009.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.shazam.com/music/web/home.html" title="Shazam">Shazam</a> won big in the «Best Overall», «Most Innovative», and «Best WOW» categories, and is much deserved.</p>

<p>What ever the criteria used to nominate the app, this event gives me the opportunity to talk about one of my favourite iPhone apps. Shazam is an amazing application that has never left my iPhone since I first installed it (after hearing about it on MacBreak Weekly). I am astound by its reliability and accuracy at recognising music on the fly, even in bad conditions (e.g. noisy). It's a killer app as well as a killer demo.</p>

<p>I admit I try out a fair number of apps now and then, but most of them end up by being uninstalled, either because I simply don't use them, get tired of them or because they simply suck.</p>

<p>The nominations revealed lots of great iPhone apps, some of which I use and enjoy (<a class="sidelist" href="http://tr.im/3uag" title="Twitterrific">Twitterrific</a>, <a class="sidelist" href="http://tr.im/3uai" title="Air Sharing">Air Sharing</a> or <a class="sidelist" href="http://tr.im/3uak" title="iChalky">iChalky</a> and <a class="sidelist" href="http://tr.im/3uan" title="Touchgrind">Touchgrind</a>) and a few I'd never heard of (<a class="sidelist" href="http://tr.im/3uat" title="Pano">Pano</a> or <a class="sidelist" href="http://tr.im/3ubd" title="Chicktionary">Chicktionary</a>), especially the game related ones.</p>

<p>I would have liked to see <a class="sidelist" href="http://tr.im/3ubl" title="Camerabag">Camerabag</a> or <a class="sidelist" href="http://tr.im/3ubr" title="NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a> get a nomination as I use them on a regular basis, and maybe a little less of the <a href="http://tr.im/3ubw" title="Ocarina">Ocarina</a> or <a href="http://tr.im/3uby" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> apps, but that is the way it goes.</p>

<p>When you think of it, this first year of iPhone development was rich and diversified. Exciting, as the best remains to come.</p>

<p>Anyway, what is your favourite iPhone app of 2008?</p>
