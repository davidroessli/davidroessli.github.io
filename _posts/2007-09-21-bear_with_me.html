<p>Please bear with me while I fool around with the markup and the css of this website. A revamp is on the way. Things might look weird, things might break, things might simply not show up.</p>

<p>I know. It's been ages since I posted anything up here. I've got a dozen drafts in <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/" title="MarsEdit: A multifeatured weblog editor for Mac OS X">MarsEdit</a> waiting to be completed and published. I'll do my best to get them out in the following weeks.</p>

<p>It's been a busy summer.</p>
