<p>You never know when this tip will come in handy, but a friend's recent misfortune nudged me to share it here.</p>

<p>If you ever forget, misplace or loose your MacBook, having your contact information on the lock screen my help you retrieve it. Some people stick a label on their laptop with their contact details, but I'm not the kind to stick anything on my MacBooks (yes, I know, don't mention it).</p>

<h3>Show a message</h3>
<p>When I discovered that in Mac OS 10.7 you could add a message to the lock screen through <strong>System Preferences &gt; Security</strong>, I immediately applied it.</p>

<p>There's an entry called «Show a message when the screen is lockedí¢â‚¬Â on the main pane of the Security settings. Click on it to add your own message:</p>

<div class="pix full nosh"><img src="https://davidroessli.com/logs/assets/img/System Preferences 3.png" alt="System Preferences" title="System Preferences" /></div>

<p>I chose to add an email address, my <a href="http://twitter.com/roessli">Twitter handle</a> and a phone number, but you can add what you like. The text shows up in between two horizontal rules at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>If you want to confirm the change, activate a screen saver with a sleep corner or lock your Mac screen, just be sure that you require a password or you won’t see your message.</p>

<p>Simple but effective.</p>
