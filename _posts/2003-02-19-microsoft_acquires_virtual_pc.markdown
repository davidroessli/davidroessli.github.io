Microsoft is now responsible for Connectix's Virtual PC line of products. According to an <a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0302/19.macbu.php">interview accorded to MacCentral</a>, Microsoft is now "responsible for supporting and shipping all current versions of Virtual PC and development for all future versions of the product".

Hum. Microsoft will now support the Virtual PC application, the operating system that runs in Virtual PC and any Windows-based Microsoft applications that run in Virtual PC.

"We think this is a great thing for the future of Virtual PC," said McDonough. There is probably nobody better than the Mac Business Unit at Microsoft to bring Windows onto the Mac."

Q: What has Connectix left now it has sold Virtual Game Station and Virtual PC ?
