<p>I was browsing my news feeds this morning at breakfast and I followed a link to an article published by our daily newspaper <a class="sidelist" href="http://letemps.ch"title="Le Temps">Le Temps</a> to discover it was eaten up by ads.</p>

<div class="pix full"><a href="/logs//assets/img/IMG_0433.png" rel="fancyzoom"><img src="https://davidroessli.com/logs/assets/img/IMG_0433.png" alt="Le Temps" title="Le Temps" /></a></div>

<p>Scrolling down to get rid of the banner ad didn't help much:</p>

<div class="pix full"><a href="/logs/assets/img/IMG_0434.png" rel="fancyzoom"><img src="https://davidroessli.com/logs/assets/img/IMG_0434.png" alt="Le Temps" title="Le Temps"  /></a></div>

<p>Scrolling to bring the article's title to the top of the window neither…</p>

<div class="pix full"><a href="/logs/assets/img/IMG_0435.png" rel="fancyzoom"><img src="https://davidroessli.com/logs/assets/img/IMG_0435.png" alt="Le Temps" title="Le Temps"  /></a></div>

<p>Now what really gets me is that I have an electronic subscription to this newspaper and my reading experience is crippled with useless promotional information I never asked for!</p>

<p>I use a cookie manager (<a class="sidelist" href="http://ghostery.com" title="Ghostery for Safari">Ghostery for Safari</a>) in my browser which prevents this kind of page littering â€“ unfortunately my iPad is devoid of such a tool…</p>

<div class="pix full nosh"><a href="/logs/assets/img/IMG_0437.png" rel="fancyzoom"><img src="https://davidroessli.com/logs/assets/img/IMG_0437.png" alt="Le Temps" title="Le Temps" /></a></div>

<p>Now, the <a href="http://app.letemps.ch" title="Le Temps (web app)">web app version of Le Temps</a> doesn't display this behaviour, <strong>but chooses to send you to a splash screen</strong> each time you hit the home button #gaaargl</p>

<div class="pix full"><a href="/logs/assets/img/IMG_0436.png" rel="fancyzoom"><img src="https://davidroessli.com/logs/assets/img/IMG_0436.png" alt="Le Temps web app" title="Le Temps web app" /></a></div>

<p>Moreover, this behaviour can't be circumvented: preventing add cookies such as <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/en/apps/smart_adserver">Smart AdServer</a> simply breaks the app by generating a JavaScript error.</p>

<p>These are sad days for a daily newspaper that I enjoy and respect. I might just give up on their electronic versions which either litter your screen with ads, forgets your credentials and makes it close to impossible to reference permanently an article.</p>

<p>Back to my newsfeed…</p>
