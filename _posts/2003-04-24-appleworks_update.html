This free update to AppleWorks for Mac OS X provides improvements to the presentation module, AppleScript, web content searching, printing, label printing, table support, and spell checking with user added words. The update provides better recognition and handling of Office 97 and Office 2000 files, improved support for multimedia files in database documents, improved web template downloading over slow internet connections, improved spreadsheet module--including Auto-Calculation, as well as enhanced support for documents which contain links. This version also supports web based templates and clipart on networks using proxy servers. <img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_right.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /></blockquote>
But beware, this <b>update requires the US version of AppleWorks</b> (eh .. reminds me of Mac OS 7, 8, 9 days ..)<br /><br />Guess we'll still have to wait a little for iWorks ;)</p>
