<blockquote><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_left.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /> The latest version of Sendmail Enabler provides users with a much-requested feature : the ability to tighten the security of the mail server to deny spammers an Open Relay. <br />

With this set, the server will only relay mail for users on the local network, which is what many people have asked for.  <img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_right.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /></blockquote>
<p>The other fonctions include a DNS activator (needed if you run a mailserver from behind an Airport Base Station, and a PHP activator.</p>
