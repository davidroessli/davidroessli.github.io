<p>I've been listening to this album for the last couple of days, and I must admit that it was just what I needed. It's energy and soulful vibrations fill the space up. Remixing can be a daunting experience and lead to disappointment. but not here.</p>

<p><a class="sidelist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Simone" title="Nina Simone on Wikipedia">Nina Simone</a>'s unique personality remains, eventhough surrounded by contemporary sounds and beats (<em>Chill House</em> or <em>Lounge</em>). You'll find most of her finest work on this album, reinvented and remixed by studio geeks like <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.francois-k.com/" title="François K. website">François K.</a> or <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.tonyrecords.net/" title="Tony Humphries website">Tony Humphries</a>.</p>

<p>Chill out and enjoy.</p>
