<p>There's an interesting article on ArsTechnica ("<a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/003/software/mac/browser/mac-browsers-1.html">Macintosh Browser Smackdown</a>") by Eric Bangeman that compares the 9 browsers available to Mac OS X users.</p>
<p>It begins with a presentation of the two main rendering engines used by today's mainstream browsers (namely Gecko and WebCore) and then proceeds to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/003/software/mac/browser/mac-browsers-2.html">test their load and rendering times</a> for various sites and test suites, as well as their CSS1/2 compliance. Follows a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/003/software/mac/browser/mac-browsers-3.html">qualitative evaluation</a> with lists of pros and cons for each of the 9 browsers.</p>
<p>The final word is a matter of what suits you best. I personally switched from Camino to Safari early this year, and haven't switched back. The development of the former has significantly slowed down since Safari was launched. I keep IE handy for those few sites on which Safai chokes, or which require IE. Camino comes in handy for the sites that require a Gecko based rendering engine.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://arstechnica.com/etc/pdf/pdf-warning.html">PDF version</a> of the article is available.</p>
