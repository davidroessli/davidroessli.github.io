According to an <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-982314.html?tag=macintouch">article in C|net</a>, Opera Software may go silent on the Macintosh.



European based Opera (Oslo, NO) released Opera 7 for Windows on Tuesday, but didn't set a date for a Macintosh release. Apple's recently released <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari browser</a> seems to be the reason. 



"<b>The mac plateform may not be viable for us any longer</b>" says Jon von Tetzchner, chief exec at Opera Soft.



This looks like another company throwing in the towel on its mac product after Apple introduces its own free version. <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-962120.html">MusicMatch did the same after the release of iTunes</a>, and <a href="http://www.macinblog.com/mac/archives/000144.html">Chimera seems doomed too</a>..
