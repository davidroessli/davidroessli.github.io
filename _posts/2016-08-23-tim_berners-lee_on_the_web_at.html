<blockquote class="excerpt">In 1989 I delivered a proposal to CERN for the system that went on to become the world wide web. This year, we celebrate the web's 25th birthday. <br /><br />Like the average 25-year-old, the web has been shaped by a vast array of influences - in fact, it was built through the efforts of millions. So this anniversary is for everyone. We should look proudly on what we've built. And as with most twentysomethings, the web's full potential is just starting to show. A radically open, egalitarian and decentralised platform, it is changing the world, and we are still only scratching the surface of what it can do.</blockquote>
