Err.. Remember Microsoft complaining at the last MWNY about the few copies of Office X sold ? Well unless Microsoft sold bags of copies of Office since, I can't see they could be bigger than .. Apple itself!?!

Jobs reported at MWSF that 5M Mac OS X users existed, and remember those <a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-955498.html">100'000 copies of Jaguar alone were sold in the first weekend of sales</a>?

Why did Reuters forget Apple ?
