<p>As March looms in once more with its load of festivities, rejoicing (and workload), Emma will turn 7 and Mathias 9 over the following couple of weeks. Birthday parties are being organised, <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davo39/2294649854/" title="Emma's 2008 bday card">birthday invitations designed</a> and printed, wish-lists amended. Here I am <a href="https://davidroessli.com/cgi-bin/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=11&search=mouton+noir" title="Been here before..">again</a> early at the <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.le-mouton-noir.com" title="Restaurant du Mouton Noir">Mouton Noir</a> writing about it.</p>

<p>It's a happy time of the year full of happy memories. It's also a reflective time. A milestone which incites you to pause and contemplate where you've come from. What if thinks were different. What if you didn't make this or that choice. Where would you be now? What would you be living?</p>

<p>More time goes on, more I get this <em>parallel track</em> feeling. Not side tracking. People you meet follow their path, that may cross yours and follow the same direction for a while, then diverge. Maybe. Or not. <strong>Synchronicity</strong>. We all have our own past and present. We all project ourselves in a hypothetical future. Sometimes.</p>

<p><strong>Then comes a special moment</strong>. When you feel in sync. With something, with someone, with yourself. It's a rare moment of fulfillment, or consciousness and awareness. You're awake, for real, in a real world, with people and friends and family around you. You are you. An entity affected by and affecting its surroundings. Connected. I find it difficult to put words on what I feel. The adjectives seem not quite right, the concept incomplete. Colours or music would convey the intimacy of this feeling much better that words. I don't want to be misread or misunderstood, but so what if I am. Sensory overload.</p>

<p>There isn't such a thing as coincidence in these matters. You connect when you're ready, when you can. Recently, I  was lucky enough to live such a situation. <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/e40ans/" title="e40ans">A special event for a special friend</a> towards the end of last year opened up new perspectives for me. Like if a curtain was drawn on part of my horizon. I met new people, true people, with whom I connected immediately. I was shy to admit it at first, but letting my feelings lead an outburst of warmth and good vibes. I was in sync with this new horizon. I had new relations. Like a web in the wind that just got stronger.</p>

<p>I was a <a href="http://liftconference.com/" title="LIFT 2008">LIFT</a> at the beginning of the month listening to <a class="sidelist" href="/logs/2008/02/lift08_new_frontiers/" title="Kevin Warwick at LIFT 2008">Kevin Warwicky</a> relate his fascinating implant tale and how he physically connected his own central nervous system to his wife's. By all means, they were connected. By wires and electronics. When we are lucky, most of us connect at other levels, less invasive, but just as powerful. Maybe even more. You get this feeling you know the other one, even though you've barely just met him or her. You share on an semi-unconscious level that leads me to imagine of what life might have been if you'd met earlier. That is very me. Projecting my present in the past. As if the conditions were stable in time, and just after writing that you connect when you're ready, when you can. Well, we didn't meet, and chances are we wouldn't have connected back then. WTF. Today is now, and the future remains to be written.</p>

<p>And mine suddenly just got richer. Thanks.</p>
