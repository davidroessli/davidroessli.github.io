This is one I stumbled on this morning: <a href="http://www.info.apple.com/subscribe/index.html">subscribe to Apple Support Updates</a>, and receive daily or weekly newsletters on the latest information available in<ul><li>Knowledge Base: Recent Changes</li><li>Recent Software Downloads</li><li>Apple Manuals</li></ul>

Unsubscribe links are available on that same page too. Might come in handy to you Mac OS IT managers out there..
