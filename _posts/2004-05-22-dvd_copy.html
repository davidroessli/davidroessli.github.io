<p>While I still have to finish my HOW-TO on duplicating DVDs (hmm), this product struck my attention: <a href="http://www.fastdvdcopy.com/">Fast DVD Copy</a>.</p>
<p>An all-in-one-one-click commercial app that duplicates your personal DVDs - and commercial ones for that matter - switched them to region free (and presumably disables Macrovision).</p>
<p>For USD 99,  version 2 allows you to select the bonus you want - or don't want for that matter. The previous version duplicated the lot, limiting to a maximum of 97 minutes the movies it could copy. Apparently, this has been addressed in the latest version.</p>
<p>Beware of the licensing scheme - install it on the computer that will be used to duplicate:</p>
<p class="quote">Your license  is valid for one computer only. If you want to  install Fast DVD Copy on a second Mac, you need to buy a second license.In  addition, your Fast DVD Copy license is computer-specific.  Your serial number will only work on the Mac  that you licensed it for.</p>
