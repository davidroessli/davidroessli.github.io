Apple (finally) posted a <a href="https://depot.info.apple.com/generic/index.html">power supply exchange program</a> for owners of mirrored drive doors Power Macs. The new ones are apparently much much more quieter.. This should bring to an end the numerous threads on Apple Discussions and on other forums.

Offer start tomorrow, and end on June 30, 2003. The shipping and handling fees is USD 19.95, or equivalent local currency.
