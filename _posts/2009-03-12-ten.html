<p>Ten. It has always been a special number to me. In a decimal or binary system. It is the first two digit number you learn.</p>

<p>Ten years. Intimately linked to a gap. Things must happen in ten years. Things must change. One must change. When I was young, ten years felt more like 'never' than 'yesterday'.</p>

<p>The distortion between looking ahead and looking back gets emphasised with time. Looking at the ten years ahead still feels free and vast, eventhough that perception is starting to swirl a bit. Looking back is another story, as my past will soon fall neatly into 5 ten year blocks. Not quite yet, but soon enough.</p>

<p>I remember reaching ten. I had a red bicycle with 5 gears and spent more time on it than on my two feet. Two digits. Waow.</p>

<p>The ten years ahead were irrelevant. My life was partly anchored in a school system, and my future was drawn out. Well, sort of. What I mean by that, is that I didn't worry about it. Here and now was the way to go. The children's way of life. The furthest event I would anticipate was the long summer holidays. Bliss. There was no way I could imagine what I would be doing in ten years, let alone think about the past ten.</p>

<p>Mathias is ten today. Ten years ago at <a class="sidelist" href="http://twitter.com/roessli/status/1315937745" title="14:26 CET">14:26 CET</a> my life and soul acquired a new dimension and I suddenly became <a class="sidelist" href="http://twitter.com/roessli/status/1314960810" title="Rich">richer</a>. Not rich as in 'wealthy', but as in 'abundant' or 'generous' or 'chockablock with'.</p>

<p>Burned into my memory cells, into the deepest part of my being, what I uncovered that day, nothing or nobody will ever take it way.</p>

<p>Happy birthday Mathias, and thank you for being there.</p>
