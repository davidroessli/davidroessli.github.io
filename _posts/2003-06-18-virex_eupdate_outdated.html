<p>Have you noticed that Virex's eUpdate function reports the May 12, 2003 definitions are the latest available ? Accordingly, that the one you find on <a href="http://www.mac.com/antivirus/update">.Mac</a> in the Virex section. But since those are over a month old, Virex keeps notifying you that they might be out-of-date ..<br />:(</p>
<p>Check <a href="http://www.networkassociates.com/us/downloads/updates/">MacAfee</a> or <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/12231">VersionTracker</a>, and you'll notice that the latest version was released on June 1, 2003 (hum).</p>
<p>So what's up with .Mac ? After all, isn't it for not having to worry about matters like theses that we pay a subscription ? (thumb down Apple). A workaround is to configure Virex to download the definition updates from MacAfee instead of .Mac. I found the following solution on <a href="http://discuss.mac.com/webx?50@12.x1gIaS8ecK6.18@.3bba1c87/1">.Mac's Virex discussion board</a>.</p>
