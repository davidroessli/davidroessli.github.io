<p>It was a <time datetime="2001-03-03T10:52+01:00">Saturday</time>, like today, eleven years ago. We rode to the maternity ward around 7:00a after Ronald (<a href="http://twitter.com/parsifalron/" rel="met friend">@parsifalron</a>) came over to take care of <span rel="child">Mathias</a>.</p>
<p><span rel="child">Emma</a> was coming to the world.</p>
<p>I've written about these <a class="sidelist" title="Birthdays" href="/tag/bday">special moments</a> before, they are ingrained deep, rooted in my heart and my soul, forever. I have goose pimples recalling the emotions of the day, its happiness and joy.</p>
<p>Now, eleven years later, while those emotions still prevail, I am proud to see you grow into an independant being, caring and generous. My little girl is turning into a young girl full of promises.</p>
<p>There is nothing like you in the World, and the World is a better place with you in it.</p>
<p>Happy birthday Emma - love // dad</p>
