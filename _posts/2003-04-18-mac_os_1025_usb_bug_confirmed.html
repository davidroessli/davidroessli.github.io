<p><a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25440">Apple has confirmed the USB bug</a> that causes a kernel panic on some systems a few minutes after startup.<blockquote><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_left.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /> A kernel panic occurs a few minutes after starting up and you are prompted to restart.<br />[..]<br />Disconnect any USB hub, if one is connected.  If disconnecting the USB hub resolves the issue, leave the hub disconnected as a temporary workaround. Note : Not all USB hubs are affected by this issue. 

If disconnecting the USB Hub does not resolve the issue, or if there is no USB hub, remove other USB devices, including Apple displays and keyboards. If the issue is resolved, use isolation troubleshooting to determine which device seems to contribute to the issue.  <img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/assets/macinblog/img/new_quote_right.gif" width="18" height="14" alt="&quote;" border="0" /></blockquote></p>
