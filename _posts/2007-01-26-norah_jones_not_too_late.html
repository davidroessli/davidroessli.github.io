<div class="pix right"><a class="sidelist" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=212415290&s=143459" title="Not Too Late"><img src="https://www.davidroessli.com/logs/assets/img/norah_jones_not_too_late.png" height="177" width="198" alt="Norah Jones Not Too Late" title="Norah Jones Not Too Late" /></a></div>

<p>I downloaded the pre-release of <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.norahjones.com/" title="Norah Jones">Norah Jones</a>' latest album "<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=212415290&s=143459" title="Not Too Late - Norah Jones">Not to late</a>" from the iTunes Store this morning. It is her third album, and I was waiting for it since "<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=5365924&s=143441" title="Feels like Home - Norah Jones">Feels like Home</a>" in 2004 and hoping it would enchante my the way "<a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=1001780&s=143441" title="Come Away With Me - Norah Jones">Come Away With Me</a>" did.</p>

<p>It needs to be listened to, again and again, let yourself go with the soft rythms of acoustic guitars and magic jazz arrangements such as the trombone break on "Sinkin' Soon" - unique. I downloaded this album before leaving for the office this morning, but its distinctive sound has already grown on me, as it certainly will with you.</p>

<p>This was a ray of sunshine at the end of a unproductive week. Enjoy.</p>
