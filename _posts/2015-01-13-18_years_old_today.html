<p><time datetime="1997-01-13">Eighteen years ago</time> we were sharing a beer watching the sun set on a beach near Colva, in Goa, India.</p>
<p>We were completing out first trip together and savouring the shared moments and magical places we'd discovered in this magnificent country. It was the stepping stone of our next journey : sharing life together.</p>
<p>Eighteen years ago still feels as yesterday ♥️ Love knows not what time is.</p>
<p> Thank you for the love and caring. Happy anniversary!</p>
