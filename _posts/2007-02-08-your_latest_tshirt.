<p>Do you buy t-shirts on internet?. I do. Essentially geeky and crypted branded one (<em>gibberish</em> for some). My latest acquisitions are from <a class="sidelist" href="http://alistapart.com/store/" title="A List Apart Store">A List Apart</a> and <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.insanelygreattees.com" title="Insanely Great Tees">Insanely Great Tees</a>. Good quality cotton, nice colours and nice prints.</p>

<p>As a result of fashion, <a class="sidelist" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tshirt" title="T-shirt on Wikipedia">t-shirts</a> have changed these last years. They seem to be weaved in lighter cotton, and offer a tighter fit. The side effect is that I've switched from an L (XL sometimes) to M size. Ls are just too large. I use to favour the thick loose fit surfer style t-shirts for a long time, but I must admit the tighter fit feels good too - to F's pleasure who's been trying to make me wear them for years.</p>

<p>I think I've worn t-shirts ever since I could get dressed alone. The colours, brand and message have evolved through the years, but the t-shirt has always been at the heart of my dressing code - to the great despair of my mum. When I think of it, I'm basically dressed the same way now as I was 20 years ago. Scary. The brands and messages have changed, but the basic look has survived. Seems I'll never grow up.</p>

<p>A quick Spotlight search for 't-shirt' in my e-mail revealed an interesting (and scary) thread of geeky t-shirts I acquired on the net over the years.</p>
