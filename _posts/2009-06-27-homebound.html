<p>Waiting in lounge at London City Airport. <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia/" title="@media">@media 2009</a> came to a close yesterday with Patrick announcing he's <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.htmldog.com/articles/tata/" title="Ta ta!">retiring from web design, development and conference organising</a>.</p>

<p>I'm feeling a little emotional, but I wish to thank Patrick for what he brought to this industry in general and to me in particular. The people I met, the talks I followed, the post conference chatting over the last 5 years have opened my eyes and broadened my horizon, both on a personal and professional level.</p>

<p>It's not the endâ€¦ <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.vivabit.com/viva" title="Viva @media">Web Directions will be picking up the event from next year</a>, so we'll meet again ;)</p>

<p>Thanks mate for everything and best of luck!</p>
