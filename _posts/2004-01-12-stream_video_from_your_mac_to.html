<p>Anyone using one of these? <a href="http://www.grandtec.com/ultimatewireless.htm" title="The Ultimate Wireless is the world's first truly wireless&nbsp; PC-to-TV converter recommended for professional presentations, computer gaming, and internet browsing on TV.">Ultimate Wireless</a>.</p>
<p>Sounds cool. You can stream video and stereo audio from your Mac (or PC) to your TV wirelessly. Just need a CRT port (VGA) and a composite input on your TV.</p>
<p>But the design isn't as cool as my favourite MP3 streamer: <a href="http://slimdevices.com/" title="Squeezebox is the smartest way to stream MP3s and Internet radio to your stereo without loss of sound quality. You won't believe how easy it is to set up and use!">Squeezebox</a> of Slim Devices.</p>
