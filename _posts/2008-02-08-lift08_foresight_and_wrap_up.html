<p>Finding the future around you. "The future is here, it's just not widely distributed" -- William Gibson.</p>

<p>Stop and think. What kind of indicators do we see around us? Blending internal and external. Bringing in more of the human and the social in the thinking of the foresight.</p>

<p>Get out on the street. More desire to keep your eyes open. Make sure to take time. Observe. Think about what you are seeing.</p>

<p>Near future survival guide:</p>

<ul>

<li>look for patterns and deep currents</li>
<li>understand the role of values</li>
<li>have a view but don't stay locked to it</li>
<li>keep your eyes open</li>
<li>look for those indicators yourself</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Stanford, Change research</em></p>

<p>Foresight to innovation</p>

<p>Ambiguity decreases with time, but doesn't reach zero. You retain ambiguity: prepare - sense | form - analyse | integrate - develop | ship in the real world</p>

<p>What is foresight? What is design? Research is in the middle.</p>

<p>Wallow in the data, even before starting foresight. Don't be at a rush.</p>

<p><em>Sorry, my attention span has suddenly droped. This is a great talk, but I can't seem to be able to synthetise it. Check out the video.</em></p>
