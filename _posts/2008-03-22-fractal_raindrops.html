<p>One story is told of how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Warne_Gates" title=""John W. Gates on Wikipedia">John W. Gates</a>, John W. Drake, and John W. Lambert, another associate, were watching a heavy rainstorm come up. It was thundering and lightning terrifically.</p>

<p>Gates stood in front of the window and watched the rain-drops slip down the windowpane. He observed that not all of them moved at the same speed. Turning to Drake, he pointed out that two raindrops, moving down evenly, offered a good chance to make a bet. Gates bet that the right drop would reach the bottom first. The stake was $100. As the race of the raindrops continued the stakes went up into the hundreds of dollars and the men cheered those raindrops with as much enthusiasm as they ever did a horse. Gate's "horse" won the race.</p>

<p class="update" style="font-family:Georgia, serif"><em>« Theres a world we've never seen<br />
Theres still hope between the dreams<br />
The weight of it all<br />
Could blow away with a breeze<br />
If your waiting on the wind<br />
Don't forget to breathe<br />
Cause as the darkness gets deeper<br />
We'll be sinking as we reach for love<br />
At least something we could hold<br />
But I'll reach to you from where time just can't go [<a class="sidelist" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackjohnson/allatonce.html" title="Lyrics of All At Once">…</a>] »</em></p>
