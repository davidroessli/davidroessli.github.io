Ough. Talk of a tentation .. I'll give this <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/acd20/">20" baby</a> a home any time ..

"The new 20-inch Cinema Display, with its 1680-by-1050 resolution, offers more pixels than our previous 22-inch product," said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of Hardware Product Marketing. "We've priced it very aggressively at $1,299 (US) so that almost everyone can now afford a stunning, widescreen Cinema Display."

Classic works though. (Read the thread on <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/">Macintouch</a>).
