<p>Days when things just go wrong, haywire, off target, awry, out of order. Murphy is never far, add a pinch of procrastination and the day has come and gone. The <em>Todos</em> remain, the sun sets and it's time to go and pick up the boy and get the dinner ready.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is another day. Another day with a little more adrenaline, new resolutions, a <em>start-it-all-over</em> meeting that will take up most of the afternoon. Tomorrow is Friday.</p>

<p>Sometime it just doesn't come out as it should. Lack of energy, lack of inspiration, lack of motivation, <abbr title="Attention deficit disorder">ADD</abbr>, I don't know.</p>

<p>Sometimes the flow isn't there, or doesn't flow as it should. Where it should. The energy just isn't directed towards the day's goals. Instead, it runs as a rebel uncovering new ideas, workarounds, algorithms, opportunities. It takes the shape of an over-detailled explanation, an in-depth demo, an over-zealous support session.</p>

<p>I like what I do, really, but sometime the time isn't the right time, harmony is wanting. Unfortunately, dead-lines are rigid and unforgiving. Tomorrow will be a day of smiles, explanations and reassuring words.</p>

<p><em>Turn on, tune in, drop out</em>.</p>
