<div class="pix"><a class="sidelist" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/formforce/3409362834/" title="Web Trend Map v4 on Flickr"><img src="/logs/assets/img/screensnapz_webtrends4.png" alt="screensnapz_webtrends4.png" border="0" width="340" height="210" /></a></div>

<p><a class="sidelist" href="http://informationarchitects.jp/" title="Information Architects Japan">Information Architects Japan</a> (<abbr>iA</abbr>) have published their annual <a class="sidelist" href="http://informationarchitects.jp/web-trend-map-4-final-beta/" title="Web Trend Map v4">Web Trend Map</a> (v4) which lists the top 50 most influential domains (333), and the people (111) associated with them onto the Tokyo Metro map.</p>

<p>The domains and people are selected by the <abbr>iA</abbr> research team based on their own set of criterias. The result, eventhough subject to discussion, is astonishing.</p>

<p>Overall, the content is very anglo-centric - is this a surprise? - both in the domains selected and the people. I was surprised not to find the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> or <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/">Al Jazerra</a> on the broadcasting line. On the other hand, how do you decide what is important in cultures/languages you don't share or speak? I have very little insight in the Asian views and usages of the web. I don't read african or chinese weblogs and I am not subscribed to any japanese <abbr>RSS</abbr> feeds. I guess the ISPs have usage stats that provide leads to a the global view, but a better image could maybe be provided by the users themselves. I think this is the approach <abbr>iA</abbr> partly adopted.</p>

<p class="update">Information Architects Japan are the guys who wrote that great article «<a class="sidelist" href="http://informationarchitects.jp/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/" title="Web Design is 95% Typography">Web Design is 95% Typography</a>» back in 2006.</p>

<p>I especially enjoy the mapping skills that have been deployed to produce this map. I can spend hours just navigating through it. I admit, visual display of quantitative data fascinates me. I'm a sucker for maps and graphs.</p>

<p>I love <a class="sidelist" href="http://thisisindexed.com/" title="Indexed">Jessica Hagy's Indexed</a> weblog { PUBLISHED WEEKDAY MORNINGS as the COFFEE BREWS } which delivers fresh and unusual ways to apprehend the current zeitgeist through a line or pie chart. Funny and very creative. Spring and good intentions,</p>

<p>I remember ordering the first Map of the Internet from <a href="http://www.thibnkgeek.com/">ThinkGeek</a> back in 1999 and being captivated by its exploration (just like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57519866@N00/3327375871/">the one Vint Cerf showed at Lift 2009</a>). The <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.opte.org/maps/">Opte Project</a> offers visual representations of the Internet, quite like my 10 year old map. Map of the Internet, Jan 2005,</p>

<p><a href="http://bitcast-a.bitgravity.com/blyon/opte/maps/static/1105841711.LGL.2D.1024x1024.png" title="Map of the Internet, Jan 15 2005. Opte Project"><img src="https://davidroessli.com/logs/assets/img/1105841711.LGL.2D.340x340.jpg" alt="Map of the Internet, Jan 15 2005. Opte Project" border="0" width="340" height="340" /></a></p>

<p>It was about at the same time I discovered the works of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte">Edward Tufte</a>, an expert in the presentation of informational graphics such as charts and diagrams. »<a class="sidelist" href="http://books.google.com/books?as_isbn=0961392126">Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative</a>», «<a class="sidelist" href="http://books.google.com/books?as_isbn=0961392142">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a>» are all time favourites of mine. Just up my street.</p>

<p>More recently, I found interesting visual representations at <a class="sidelist" href="http://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> (A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language), namely a <a class="sidelist" href="http://xkcd.com/256/" title="Map of online communities">map of online communities</a>,</p>

<p><a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/online_communities.png" title="Map of onine communities, 2007 xkcd."><img src="https://davidroessli.com/logs/assets/img/xkcd_online_communities_340.png" alt="Map of onine communities, 2007 xkcd" border="0" width="340" height="321" /></a></p>

<p>Or a <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.xkcd.com/195/" title="Map of the Internet IPv4 space">map of the internet IPv4 space</a> 2006,</p>

<p><a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/map_of_the_internet.jpg" title="Map of the internet IPv4 space, 2006 xkcd."><img src="https://davidroessli.com/logs/assets/img/xkcd_map_of_the_internet_340.png" alt="Map of the internet IPv4 space, 2006 xkcd" border="0" width="340" height="494" /></a></p>

<p>Anyway, all this to tell you to check out <abbr>iA</abbr>'s latest revision of the <a href="http://informationarchitects.jp/web-trend-map-4-final-beta/">Web Trend Map</a>. Enjoy.</p>
