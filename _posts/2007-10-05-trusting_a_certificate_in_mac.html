<p>This is by no means mission critical, but I have been plagued with a keychain certificate glitch ever since I migrated to my Mac Pro in August. Each time I opened Mail.app it warned me that the certificate for one of my mail hosts was "not in the root certificate could not be verified" and asked me if I wanted to continue.</p>

<p>I changed the trusting settings of the certificate, but to no avail, the glitch remained. Checking the certificate is mentionned "This certificate is not in the trusted root database", but <strong>how do you add a certificate to the root database?</strong></p>

<p>Well, it turns out it's all a matter of importing it properly:</p>

<p>1. Open Keychain access, and select File > Import (or double click the certificate).</p>

<p>2. Select the X.509Anchors keychain and import the certificate (usually a file file a .cer extension). <strong>Don't import it into your login keychain</strong>, or it won't be added to the root database.</p>

<p>3. The certificate will still be marked "This certificate is not in the trusted root database".</p>

<p>4. Quit and relaunch Keychain Access for it to display "This certificate is valid".</p>

<p>No more warnings. Bliss.</p>
