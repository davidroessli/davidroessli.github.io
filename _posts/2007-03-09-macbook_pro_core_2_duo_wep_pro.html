<p>Apple released an <a class="sidelist" href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/airportextremeupdate2007002.html" title="AirPort Extreme Update 2007-002">Airport Update 2007-002</a> that fixes connection <a class="sidelist" href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=715044" title="Airport reception problem on brand new MacBook Pro Intel Core 2 Duo">problems that were nagging MacBook and MacBook Pro users</a> ever since the release of the MacBook Pro C2D. Contrary to the <a href="https://davidroessli.com/logs/2007/01/yet_another_wifi_network_yawn/" title="Yet another WiFi network (yawn)">previous one released earlier</a> this year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="simple">This update also improves compatibility for the MacBook Core 2 Duo and the MacBook Pro Core 2 Duo when using certain third-party access points configured to use WEP Open System security.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't test it personally as <a href="https://davidroessli.com/logs/2007/03/on_hardware_failures/" title="On hardware failures">my <abbr title="MacBook Pro">MBP</abbr> hasn't returned from repair</a> yet, but initial reports from friends are encouraging. Apparently both issues related to connecting to a third party WiFi access point and dropping connections are solved.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>[UPDATE] I can confirm it is fixed! My <abbr title="MacBook Pro">MBP</abbr> doesn't drop its connection anymore, and connects successfully to third party WiFi <abbr title="Access Points">AP</abbr> (tested on Zyxel and Linksys).</p>
