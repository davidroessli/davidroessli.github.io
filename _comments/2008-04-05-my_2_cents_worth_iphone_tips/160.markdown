Hi David, 
thank you for posting this information .

I am having a weird problem. my phone was unlocked to use in Switzerland.  recently I've connected iphone to mac and it installed some software.
it was working fine and after a week when I 've to charge it , it was not taking the power(my phone is not getting charged). You have any idea how to overcome this problem?

thank you..
