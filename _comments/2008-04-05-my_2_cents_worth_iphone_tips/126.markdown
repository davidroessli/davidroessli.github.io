I had a flawless experience when ordering one from NextWay (http://www.nextway.ch). It worked out of the box. I think they must have done most of the patching themselves (adn added a button to their online store on the desktop).
:)
Highly recommended.

PS: any idea when will the 3G model will ship and will it be available in Switzerland?
