While I am a huge fan of AlSoft's Disk Warrior (disclaimer: I knew Al and a bunch of his employees) and go to it first to fix things because it's better and non-destructive (until I tell it to be), I never could bring myself to run PlusOptimizer (AlSoft's defrag tool) in the real-time continuous optimizer mode he recommended.  

But I'm pretty sure the PlusOptimizer was safe in the listed conditions and was designed to be fail-safe (i.e. if it failed due to a bug, it was supposed to be able to recover, just like his drive fixing utilities.)

The down side of optimizing was always if you had a corrupt B-tree and two files "owned" the same block and one moved it.  I always ran DiskWarrior/Norton/Disk First Aid first, and didn't optimize unless I was clean.

But yeah, I appeciate OS X and not needing to defrag for performance reasons.
