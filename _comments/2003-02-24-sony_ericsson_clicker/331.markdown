So you bought a t68i thinking it would sync up all the events from your Mac did you?  And now you're disappointed and find the phone useless as a calendar because you can never be sure if you're free on a certain day or not?  Well...



I strongly suggest that you immediately send a quick note to the President of Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications about this matter.  He can be contacted by:



    e-mail katsumi.ihara@sonyericsson.com



    Mr. Katsumi Ihara

    Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications Ltd.

    Sony Ericsson House

    202 Hammersmith Road

    W6 7DN London

    United Kingdom



Below are a couple of links to some examples of messages published by Sony Ericsson that led me to believe I was purchasing a phone that would synchronise ALL of my calendar events not only SOME of those events.



On these pages, you will find claims containing keywords like "up-to-date", "compatible", "same" and "accurate", such as:



* "Apple's hot new synchronizing software keeps your iCal information and Mac OS X Address Book up-to-date on your Bluetooth-enabled mobile phone"



* "This product [iSync] is compatible with the following Sony Ericsson phones: ... T68i"



* "the same up to date address book and calendars everywhere Ã± on their Mac and in their pocket"



* "customers using the new Sony Ericsson T68i phone are ... keeping their ... calendar up-to-date between their Mac and their phone"



* "You can have your ... calendar with you wherever you go, and you'll know the information is accurate"
