@Mary: the only way to activate your Kindle (International version) if you are out of the US is to use Audible's File Manager software.

The caveat is that it runs only on Windows, so if you are using a Mac, you'll need to run it under Parallels or VMWare.

The problem is that web browsing is deactivated (restricted) out of the US, so that the Kindle can't reach Audible's servers for activation.

More info on the Kindle's forum <a href="http://ro.ess.li/kindle/audible/">http://ro.ess.li/kindle/audible/</a>
