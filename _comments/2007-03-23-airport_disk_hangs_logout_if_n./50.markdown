Hi

I have a related problem.  Not only does my logout hang, but my logins hang as well.

The only way I can login is to turn off the airport extreme.  Or I should turn off my airport before I logout each time - both of which SUCK.

I have tried your suggestion and that did not fix the problem.

Any other tips?
