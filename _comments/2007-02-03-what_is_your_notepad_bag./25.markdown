For one reason, I can't stop using my <a href="http://www.freitag.ch" rel="nofollow">Freitag</a> bag that hasn't really been designed for laptops but is quite okay with a pouch like the <em>Brain Cell</em>. 

Is it because of the <em>"less bag"</em> factor, or the feeling it gives to own a unique design (every Freitag bag is different) or is it the snobbishness to wear a brand that has entered the permanent collections of some museums of modern art, I don't know. Maybe it is simply because I like bags that don't look new.

Anyhow, my next <em>"new"</em> bag might be a <a href="http://www.crumpler.com.au" rel="nofollow">Crumpler</a> because of their simple, well-thought designs and their wild branding.
