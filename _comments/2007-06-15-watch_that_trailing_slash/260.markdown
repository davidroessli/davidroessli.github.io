I am lost, I noticed google webmaster tools has me indexed with the trailing slash half of the time and because I am using wordpress on a windows server I am having a hard time fixing the issue.  So I am trying to figure out if I should (for SEO purposes) use the slash even though none of my backlinks point that way.
Any help on this would be much appreciated.
thanks
