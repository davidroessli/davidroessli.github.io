I am an eMac Superdrive user, using FAst DVD copy for first time. My home DVD player cannot read DVD-R discs but when I try to see movies copied by a friend of mine with a PC, then even if are copied on a DVD-R disc, my home player can read the. 

Also my player can read many of the copies DVD movies we bought when living in Asia. No problems. 

All this is quite strange, because when I copy with Fast DVD copy, using same type of disc my home player cannot read it. 

How this can be ? 

Is there anything to set in FAst DVD copy application ? 

I read in their website that this application can only use DVD-R. IS that the reason and why other DVD-R can be read ? 

Hope somebody can solve this problem, because I don't want to buy a new video system just for this. 

Thanks
