This might be a question you have been asked, but I have not yet found a 100% direct answer...

I have a G4 MAC running Final Cut Pro 3.0.4 on OSX and iDVD on OS9. I recently purchesed iLife, (for the iDVD 3 upgrade). Since buying (and waiting to receive it) I've been reading about needing a "superdrive" How do I know if my Mac G$ has one? I have been burning iDVD 1 without a problem. Is it safe to assume I have it built in or how can check? Thank you in advance for your help!
