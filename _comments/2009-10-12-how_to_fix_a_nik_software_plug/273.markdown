NIK Silver Efex has been crashing my CS3 ever since I upgraded to Snow Leopard. I've tried reinstalling everything, downloading a new copy of Silver Efex, removing duplicate fonts, creating a new login user on my Mac (both suggestions from NIK Support), and now I've tried your recommendation. But, NIK still crashes CS3. If I remove NIK completely (something NIK's "Uninstall" feature somehow neglects to do), CS3 runs great.

Is this problem common with NIK and Snow Leopard? They don't seem to want to get back to me on this anymore.
