@enrique: thanks!! 

You are right to point this out. I left it out of the above tutorial beacuse none of its URLs appear in the address bar.

I believe you could symlink a`mt-static` folder into your blog's folder, and it should work just fine.

The configuration takes relative paths too (you don't have to specify a full URL):
<pre>StaticWebPath  /mt-static/</pre>

So creating a symlink like,

<pre>ln -s /somewhere/on/your/disk/mt-static/ /your/blog/mt-static/</pre>

should do the trick.

WRT StyleCatcher, I'm not sure about it's default behaviour. I'll give it a look.
