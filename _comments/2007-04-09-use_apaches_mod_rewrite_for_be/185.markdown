Thanks for the tutorial David, it helped me a lot.
However, how do you deal with the mt-static folder. Now that it is symlinked in the cgi-bin folder, It seems like I can't point to it from my new domain (I'm using MT's StyleCatcher which creates a <code>@import</code> in my CSS to a style inside mt-static.).

Using your technique, should one have a separate mt-static folder per domain/blog? Or could one simply create a symlink of the mt-static folder somewhere out of the cgi-bin folder? Not sure if I'm very clear...

Thanks again! // e
