Great tutorial. I've got the same issue, a separate domain for a single MT install driving multiple blogs.

I want to your technique for one of the blogs I've got running, but don't want to break the others.

Say I've got Movable Type installed at:

http://mt.example.com/

publishing different blogs to different domains (all on the same server):

http://domain1.com/
http://domain2.com/
http://domain3.com/

If I create a symlink between...

mt.example.com/cgi-bin and domain1.com/cgi-bin 

...what happens with the other domains that are referencing mt.example.com/cgi-bin? Will they still work as usual with the ugly urls or will they break? 

Thanks.
