I have had similar problems with isync and T3. It finally clicked on the differnet names for the conduits, but I don't really understand how you then managed to make isync work with Palm desktop. I tried re-installing both programs without success and  have abandoned it at the moment waiting for Apple to list the T3 as a supported device for isync 3 (it still isn't)

Any help gratefully received.

Chris
