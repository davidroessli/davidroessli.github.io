For those who asked: in order to use Palm Desktop under Mac OS 10.3 (Panther), it needs to be installed as root. That worked for me.

In order to login to your Mac as user root and doing a fresh install. Make sure you have the the latest iSync palm conduit installed too.

Enabling root access: If you use NetInfo Manager (in /Applications/Utilities/) to enable the root account, log out, log in as root, install Palm Desktop, log out, log in as yourself, relaunch NetInfo Mgr and disable root, it works fine.
