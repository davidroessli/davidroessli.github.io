Hello Dave;



  Please! More options when control-clicking (or right mouse button clicking). I'd like to see a "Back" (to previous page) and a "Close Window" option here too. Even a Spring-Back option would be good here as well as in the address bar.



  Also a full screen mode without the standard Mac Menu bar, and a "Move" hand in addition to the scroll bars. A method of chaning the location of items in the Safari Menu Bar would help too.



Thanks for the chance to speak up!
