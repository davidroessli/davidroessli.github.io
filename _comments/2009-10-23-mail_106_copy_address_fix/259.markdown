@Alexander MacDougall: did you copy the whole command?

<em> defaults write com.apple.mail AddressesIncludeNameOnPasteboard -bool NO</em>

The file is located in /usr/bin/defaults which should be in your path. Try,

<em>/usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.mail AddressesIncludeNameOnPasteboard -bool NO</em>

(all on the same line)
