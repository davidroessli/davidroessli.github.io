Like you (and many others) I had to establish an iTunes account with a non-Apple email years ago, and later my Apple email was used for my contacts, email, etc. with iCloud. So I've always had 2 accounts:  @me.com / @icloud.com email for contacts/calendars/email etc, and my @gmail account for iTunes and apps. Now what do I do for Family Sharing? iOS 8 insists on only 1 email account. If I pick my music, etc. I lose my iCloud contacts on my phone and visa versa.
