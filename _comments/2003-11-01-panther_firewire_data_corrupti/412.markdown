We have seen two PowerBook G4 (GigaBit, 667 MHz) with a blown internal firewire port after connecting a external self powered 400 firewire RAID drive. The RAID works just fine on a G# or G$ desktop and works fine with a $17 PCMICA IEEE 1394 CardBus pluged into the PowerBook.  Both PowerBooks run 10.3, the desktops run 10.2.
