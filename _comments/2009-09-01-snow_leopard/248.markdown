Thanks for the great info.  On 10/30/09 I downloaded all the required Canon drivers and applications to use Pixma MP980 in Snow Leopard.  

The Canon page is quite confusing, with many different software packages.  I called Canon tech support (1-800-OK-CANON), and they guided me through the selection of which packages I needed to print from/scan from/scan to Pixma MP980 <-> Snow Leopard.
