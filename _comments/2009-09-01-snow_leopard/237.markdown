My AudiaHijack Pro was not compatible and wasnâ€™t upgraded, in fact on your list of  Snow Leopard Compatibility List.  apps it indicated it wasnâ€™t compatible and an upgrade was forth coming.  Also Snow Leopard didnâ€™t create a root folder to indicate which apps werenâ€™t compatible.  I discover those apps when I use them  ie. . .  TuneTools . . ..
