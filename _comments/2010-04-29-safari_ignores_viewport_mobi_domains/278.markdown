I'm glad I found this post, I thought I was going mad!

While I understand the reasoning behind why Apple might do this, changing behaviour purely based on the domain is madness.

You should at least be able to override it. I'd suggest the presence of a meta viewport should tell Safari "hey, I know what I am doing, let me be". If the meta viewport is missing sure then lock it down to 100% or whatever its _actually_ doing.
