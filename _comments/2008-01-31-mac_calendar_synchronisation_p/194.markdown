I have had the same problem with a small twist.  All of my data is in the cloud on mobile me.  There is no copy on my computer.  How can I make a backup off of mobile me and then work off of the backup to my local machine.  I am running 10.4.11 on one laptop and tower and 10.5.6 on my mac mini.  HELP!!!!!!
