I was just running into the same problem but after reading this post I was able to fix it in 1 minute. 

I simply re-created the calendar data from my main machine (which holds the most up to date calendars) overwriting the old calendar data on .Mac. I just used the regular advanced feature for that. Afterwards I was able to sync the re-written calender data onto my MacBook PRO. 

While this may not work for everybody it is a fast thing to try before you hit the command line purging this manually.

Hope this may be helpful for some
Stefanie
