I have Greg's same exact problem.  The good data is on mobileme and my iphone, with healthy syncing between the two.  But my iCal in OS X 10.5.5 is way out of date and I'd just like to replace it with what's on mobileme.  Yet I get the "inconsistent data" message when I try to reset data from mobileme.  Annoying.
