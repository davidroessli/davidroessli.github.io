I had this same problem with Contacts [only].

Stephanie's post in #3 above worked for me also.  I had tried a number of steps in the Apple forums. 

My mistake, I believe, is in my reluctance to replace the MobileMe data in the cloud with the data that was on my Mac Mini [Snow Leopard] (my "sync/push server").  The Mac Pro (Leopard) silently stopped synching Contacts with the rest of my stuff - iPhone, Mac Mini, Macbook Pro.  

Using Stephanie's one minute suggestion I have resolved the problem.   Had that not worked then I'd have had to run through the full solution in this blog.

Thanks very much all. It has saved me days of grief :-)
