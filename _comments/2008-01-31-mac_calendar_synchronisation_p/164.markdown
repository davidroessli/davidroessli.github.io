@David: I've updated the MobileMe System prefs several times ... I'm running 10.5.5. I've completely erased my iSync device list, as I no longer need to sync my trusty SE600i via Bluetooth (which was a painless and reliable process >_<) since I got the iPhone.

Taking a superficial look at the solutions, my safest bet would be to copy --by hand-- my calendars and contact details from the phone to the iMac; as the trend in the posted solutions is to "sync from scratch" online from the "definitive" copy on the computer. 

I'm also tempted to leave things as they are for the moment, as the iPhone/MobileMe relationship is so healthy. Not happy that my iMac can't join in as a third party!

Also, I may have to reinstall OSX --again-- as I've just finished trouble-shooting some nasty wireless networking problems. This may give me a clean slate once I re-establish my, my wife's files/account status etc.
