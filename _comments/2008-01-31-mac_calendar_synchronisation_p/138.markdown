Just wanted to add that these instructions also cured my sync woes as well.  I have an iMac and recently also purchased a MacBook.  Some stuff synced over to the MacBook but some did not, specifically bookmarks and calendars.  After following these instructions now everything is merrily syncing along.  Thanks for the great post!
