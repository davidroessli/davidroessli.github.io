Apple really is very poor at managing localisation. The iTunes store you use should not be affected by the region format you use - I'm currently US-based (for now, anyway!), but prefer the UK language/region format on both OS X and iOS because of things like date/time formatting (I hate Month/Day/Year) and spelling. That's obviously not as big a deal as changing the entire language in order to make things compatible, but it's still annoying. and hopefully they've changed this in later versions of iOS and iTunes.  

(Also, I'd like you to know that I've linked to some of your articles about internationalisation on my 'Inclusive Tech' blog, a guide to developers on creating more inclusive websites. One of my emphases is on internationalisation.)
