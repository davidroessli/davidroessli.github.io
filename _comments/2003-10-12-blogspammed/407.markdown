I just posted about comment spam this afternoon to my own blog, and I've commented with this helpful link to two other sites. So many people are talking the issue. A plug-in is due tomorrow that hopes to help us with this problem. I'm looking forward to trying it:



<a href="http://www.jayallen.org/journey/2003/10/mtblacklist_monday_hell_or_high_water" rel="nofollow">http://www.jayallen.org/journey/2003/10/mtblacklist_monday_hell_or_high_water</a>



I'm not spamming with the link. I have no idea who the author is other than he seems to know what he's talking about and I'm really tired of the spam like everyone else. :-)
