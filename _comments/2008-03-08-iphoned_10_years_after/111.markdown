Nokia lover then.. 
My first was a Swatch one, heavy and huge filled with green led.
Then always Motorola (8200, 8400, Star Tac, M60, V300, Peeble and now Ming) with two extras: Ericsson T68i and Sony Ericsson something-model, the one with the oled display outside.

A hystory in phones... what a time =)
