Sorry we kept you waiting for so long. MacPay X has been released today and is available for download right now.
But don't tell us we were the ones to pull the plug on another faithful OS 9 config. Because, yes, OS X is three, but its predecessor kept us going for 20 years. After all we wouldn't be there without it.

Best regards from the Quartesoft Team.
