That's funny. The new French translation works well now but even I had (and still have trouble) with the English version. Every time I read it, I can not for the life of me dismiss the idea that we are stuck with MS Office for the duration of our lives. And then I can not figure how iLife is supposed to correct that torture -- except as relief.
