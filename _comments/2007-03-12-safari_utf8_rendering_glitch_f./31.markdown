I should mention that the <em>proper</em> solution for the CSS generated content issue would be to serve your stylesheet with a MIME type that mentions the encoding of the content.  <strong>Content-type: text/css; charset=utf-8</strong> will have your curly-quotes looking splendid in Safari 2.0 as well as the nightly builds, and is safer than relying on the specific heuristic used to determine the encoding in a stylesheet.
