I've just been having the same problem. My solution was to escape the UTF-8 characters in the CSS file; for example, rather than using
<pre><code>content: "â€œ"</code></pre>
or similar, use
<pre><code>content: "\201C"</code></pre>
It doesn't <em>cure</em> the problem, but it works in all the browsers I've tested without needing to play around with MIME types or conditional rules.
