Looks like apple is doing something about this.. They know it's broke, I ended up buying a new router (apple brand, of course) and everything was fixed (duh).  Basically, it was bait and switch.

I posted my owes on the discussions only to have my ID discontinued without warning.  After buying a MacBook Pro and a Extreme router, with apple quicktime pro, my ID has been discontinued.

man, that's evil!

Hope they fix it.. and I'm sure they can try and give me my posting privileges back...
