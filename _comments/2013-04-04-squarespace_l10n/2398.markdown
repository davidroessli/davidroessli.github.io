Hi David thank you so much for this excellent post! 

I only have one problem... for some reason it's translating the date (the day number) to be one day before the actual date. See screenshot: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ifj8gev2xbus2c6/Screenshot%202015-06-21%2020.23.30.png?dl=0

Any idea why this might be happening? It might be worth mentioning that it flashes correctly in english for a millisecond... Any advice for a fix?

Thanks in advance for your time!
