David, thanks a lot for this excellent article. Everthing worked well for me expect setting the localisation to German. 

I added to following snippet to Settings - Code Injection - Header): 

<script>
Y.use("lang/datatype-date-format_de-DE",
  function(Y) {
      Y.Intl.setLang("datatype-date-format", "de-DE");
  }
);
</script>

Unfortunately this did not change anything in the calendar widget. Months names are still displayed in English.
