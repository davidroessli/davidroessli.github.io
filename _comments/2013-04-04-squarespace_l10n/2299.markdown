Hello.

I've tried this solution with mixed results.

What I have on the index did not change (the calendar & two "sumaries" from blogs).

The dates on the blog listings did work.

I'm using the Bedford template.

Do you have any idea why and/or ideas as to how to work around these issues?

Thanks in advance,
