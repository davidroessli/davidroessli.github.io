I am running System Panther 10.3.6 on a G-4 Dual 500 Mhz. When I try to install a new piece of software, either through an installer or just dragging and dropping, I get the following message: "The finder cannot complete the operation because some data in 'fdi0rcv.3me' could not be read. (Error code-36). 
Does anyone have a solution to this problem? I am not computer literate enough to do the solutions as proposed above.
Thank you.
