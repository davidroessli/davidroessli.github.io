I had the same problem installing on my son's B&W G3.  Then I remembered I had installed Dansguardian which is a Net Nanny kind of thing that prevents the lad from visiting pornographic web sites (accidentally, of course).  Dansguardian works by installing a proxy server on the local Mac (on his B&W G3).  I disabled the proxy server in the Network preferences, installed the updates, and then re-enabled the proxy settings.  Voila!  HTH.
