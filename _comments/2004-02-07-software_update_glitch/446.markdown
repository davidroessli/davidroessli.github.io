Having same problem. Looking over the suggestions it seemed that this was easiest to implement (thanks Greg):

"When I did softwareupdate -a -i, I noticed that update was trying to download from akamai.net. I had akamai servers blocked in my router/firewall when I was trying to gid rid of adware servers. Come to find out, it's the server Apple uses to distribute software! I unblocked the server, and now everything works fine again."

I use Little Snitch to block some apps from unauthorized communication. I freed up Software Update from connection restrictions and immediately had some success where the error msg had previously prevented installation. Some success. Some programs still didn't load.

So I tried Software Update again, and more updates were installed, but again not all. Once more did the trick.

Doesn't make any sense to me, but that's not unusual. You'd think there would be a common thread among these solutions...
