I had the same problem with Software Update giving me the "make sure you have permissions to /tmp/501/TemporaryItems/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate" and after trying numerous possible solutions, I finally figured out what was wrong! When I did softwareupdate -a -i, I noticed that update was trying to download from akamai.net. I had akamai servers blocked in my router/firewall when I was trying to gid rid of adware servers. Come to find out, it's the server Apple uses to distribute software! I unblocked the server, and now everything works fine again. *sigh*
