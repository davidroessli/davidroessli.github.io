This won't solve your problem as you haven't installed Xcode on your server. But for those who did: 

From mango:

Well, I found out what was preventing Software Update from working. Apple's uninstaller for Xcode also uninstalled "tar" and "gnutar" from /usr/bin. I had to use Pacifist to manually extract and install those two components from the base package on my Panther disk. Thanks, Apple. Nicely done with that uninstaller.
