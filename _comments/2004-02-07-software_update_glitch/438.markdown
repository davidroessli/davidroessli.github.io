I had the same problem when using automatic update, I checked all above tips and I found no problems.  A reboot & running softwareupdate -a -i as root seemed to fix the problem on 3 out of 4 machines.  I assume that it was a faulty download? anyway more interesting is that I had moved my sever admin tools folder (after installation) from Applications/Server to Applications/Utilities/Server just to tuck it away from curious students. Software update continually tried to update the Applications/Server (noted by a folder named "server" magically applearing after repeated updates) I have since moved it back to the Applications folder and all seems well.
