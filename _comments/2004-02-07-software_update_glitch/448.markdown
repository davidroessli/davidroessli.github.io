I had a similar problem to what Kristian posted on February 9, but my /tmp simlink was completely gone. I first noticed the problem when I couldn't print--at all!

For non-UNIX types, the shareware app Printer Setup Repair from Fixamac Software really did the trick for me. No, I don't work for them--didn't even buy the app because I'm a poor grad student, but I would recommend it to anyone with this problem or something similar.
