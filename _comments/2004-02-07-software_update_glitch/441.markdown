Kristian,

Thank you so much for your post at <a href="http://www.macinblog.com/2004/02/software_update.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.macinblog.com/2004/02/software_update.html.</a>

After much wading through endless discussions and recommendations, your suggestion ACTUALLY WORKED!!! 

I don't understand terminal too well but I am grateful for your post.

I hope that others will benefit from this.

In my case, I did not encounter that particular error message "make sure you have permissions to write to /tmp/501/ ..." until I tried to install Apple's Security Update 9-30-2004 on my G4 running10.3.5.  And then other apps wouldn't install either.

But your fix worked and no problems since.

Thank you.

-Greg
