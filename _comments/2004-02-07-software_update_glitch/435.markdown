thanks to tyio for the tip...i had installed Xcode and later uninstalled it b/c it ate too much disk space.  however, even after i removed it, my updates worked for a while.  go figure.  i have to download and manually install updates at the moment. while it's a bit of a pian, as long as that's the worst problem i have, i'll be ok
