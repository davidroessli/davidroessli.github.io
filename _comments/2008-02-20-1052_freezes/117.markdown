I am a 7 day old Mac virgin. Top of the range MAC BOOK PRO and 3 freezes - this bug is all over the web (90,000 + hits if you search for 10.5.2 freezes)..

Seems this problem had been around since late Jan (10.5.2 and Graphics updates may be the cause).

3 calls to Apple support and they acknowledge a problem, one guy confessed they (Apple) are not near a fix and stumped.. SAD..
