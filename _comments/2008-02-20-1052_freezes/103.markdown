Same here. Freezes started happening after the graphic update. Random but seem to be triggered by Safari + running on battery. I repaired permissions and freezes stopped for 3 days but then again it froze the last night :(

I feel exactly as you said -- it's sad to lose trust in a reliable tool (MacBook Pro).

I hope for a fix from Apple...
