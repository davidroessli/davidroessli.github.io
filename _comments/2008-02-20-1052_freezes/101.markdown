Sadly, the freezes are <strong>still occuring</strong>. They usually happen when I'm running on battery power, whatever the application running.

On the gripe level, please be aware that the <a href="http://www.siliconimage.com/products/product.aspx?id=32" rel="nofollow nofollow">SiliconImage ExpressCard 34 eSATA host controller</a> generates kernel panics under Leopard when inserted or ejected from my MacBook Pro. The <a href="http://www.siliconimage.com/support/supportsearchresults.aspx?pid=32&cid=3&ctid=2&osid=3&" rel="nofollow nofollow">current driver is v1.1.9</a> and this includes cards sold by <a href="http://www.sonnettech.com/product/tempo_sata_express34.html" rel="nofollow nofollow">Sonnet</a> and <a href="http://www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?pid=11033" rel="nofollow nofollow">LaCie</a>. Sucks.
