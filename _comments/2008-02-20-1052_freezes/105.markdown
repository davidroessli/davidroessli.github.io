Hi there D, 

10.5.2 upgrade is terrible. Same as You, I've been completely confident in using the Software Update without any hesitations, but now ...

I mean, my MBP is freezing at least once per day, my Garageband is unusable, Safari chrashes so often that I'm switching to Firefox again ....WTF.

And one can only dream of the times when I had like 50-100 _working_ days of uptime on my PB G4.

I'm not upgrading anymore before some time period given to see what the other (un)lucky users are reporting.

Thanks for the tips, but in my case it didn't help :(
