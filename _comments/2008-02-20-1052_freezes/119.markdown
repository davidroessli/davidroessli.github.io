I have been experiencing the sudden freeze up of Leopard ever since upgrading to 10.5.2 back in February. After reviewing the kernel crisis log with a fella at the Apple genius bar at our local store, I was told my MacBook Pro probably has a problem with the ram. I installed new ram and still have the same symptoms, e.g. random freeze ups that occur sometimes when I'm first bootin up, other times after several hours of use.

I wonder if Apple really knows there is a problem with Leopard vis-a-vis MacBook Pro freez ups and Leopard 10.5.2. Can anyone confirm a documented conversation with Apple's technical staff on this issue?

If not, can someone advise as to how to go about getting in touch with the Apple technical people?
