As this issue is growing, an interesting fix was posted on <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1365569&tstart=60" title="Unresponsive Keyboard and Trackpad problem FIXED/RESOLVED" rel="nofollow nofollow nofollow nofollow nofollow nofollow">Apple Discussions</a> which you might want to try if you are running into this problem:

<blockquote><strong>This is a HARDWARE problem!</strong><br />
After playing around with removing the battery and noticing that this often returned functionality to the keyboard I surmised that this had some sort of physical aspect.<br />
Sure enough, there is a section of copper colored tape/wiring exposed in the batter slot that is slightly bowed where it's smallest.<br />
<strong>When I depressed this with my finger tip on this portion to basically flatten it out flush against the housing; I found that all functionality was restored!</strong></blockquote>

As amazing as it sounds, it has actually worked for a number of readers who were suffering from this issue.
