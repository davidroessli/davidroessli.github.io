David: I'm having a similar problem but from my crude diagnosis, it's not a "HARDWARE problem"  I have boot camp installed on my MBP 15" and I booted into Windows XP and it seems to run fine off of the battery.

I don't know if this helps you but I figured that I'd throw that tidbit of information into the cosmos and see what happens.
