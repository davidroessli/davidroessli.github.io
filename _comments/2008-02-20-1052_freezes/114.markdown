Things are getting WORSE.

My MacBook Pro not only freezes when running on battery with Airport WiFi enabled, it <strong>now randomly shutdowns</strong>. Bang. Just like if you'd pulled the plug from a desktop machine.

I reinstalled a fresh copy of 10.5, and updated to 10.5.2 with the latest Security Updates and Airport patches.

At reboot, the system logs show:

<code>Mar 18 21:31:25 cinnamon kernel[0]: Previous Shutdown Cause: 0</code>

The freezes generated a cause 3 at reboot,

<code>Mar 18 21:31:25 cinnamon kernel[0]: Previous Shutdown Cause: 3</code>

My patience has almot ran out. Just as my trust in this computer.

The thread on Apple Discussions is getting longer and longerâ€¦
