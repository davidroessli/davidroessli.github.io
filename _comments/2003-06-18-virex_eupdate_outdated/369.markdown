Thanks for the advice. I've been trying to get this to work since I bought my new G4 iMac a few months ago. The folks at Applecare don't even want to here about it...they tell you to call Virex. Tried to explain that I thought the only problem was that the URL for the eUdate server was wrong..."join a discussion group, I can't help you," is all I got in response. Applecare level 1 support ranks as one of the poorest experiences I can recall with customr service.
