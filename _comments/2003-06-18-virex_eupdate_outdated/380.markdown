Thx for the info i was about to give up on Virex, I have a PC as well and for 5 years I have had Norton in the 5 years I have had no complains, everything updates they have new updates all the time, my system has been great in all that time. I got the virex for my mac and it was "welcome to hell" have you guys visited the virex site for the epdates OMG I think blind man made the site, you just cant seem to get to what u need. I was about to trash this prog if it wasnt for htis post.
