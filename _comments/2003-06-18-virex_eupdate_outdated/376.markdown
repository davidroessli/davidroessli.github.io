Thanks for the infomation - unfortunately, I'm getting the following error message:



"Virex is unable to connect to eUpdate server. Please try again later. You can skip the eUpdate and continue using Virex."



I have filled out the correct information perfectly as stated above, so maybe someone can tell me what the problem is.



Thanks in advance.
