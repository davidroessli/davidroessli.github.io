I'm experiencing a couple of problems with this release which were absent from the previous betas:

+ the HTML templates keyboard shortcuts don't work.
+ the backspace key works like the tab key when you're in the Title field: instead of erasing the previous character, it switches to the "Main" pane.

Anybody notice such behaviours ? I'm sure Adriaan is going to squash these before you finish reading this. He is extremely responsive.
