Then I wish kids a very happy bday (and I want an invitation tooo =P)! Such moments are always happy and full of joy.. the joy you can read in the eyes and on the lips of those creatures.

Will step off from the "baaaaaaah" on the MN website (fancy but too sheepy =P) and want to drop down few words from a song that fill your ending lines:

Release your innovations
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten

 - Natasha Bedingfield
