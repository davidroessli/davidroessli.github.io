craig i think you are right and don't get me wrong i am not for the war in irak and all the thousands of dead we see everyday...but i have hope that things will work even with a man like bush leading the whole situation. It is too easy to say "moi je suis pour un desarmement pacifique avec l'objectif de paix" because how do you figure out that one enters irak and desarms the country without attacking?
especially with saddam hussein in power and the so many number of terrorists?
