I can't understand some of your comments... 
"avec les atrociter que les americains et anglais on fait la en iraq" - have you not seen pictures of thousands of Kurds killed by Hussein? Cela se sont des atrociters. 
 "juste de dire " crime" et terrorisme contre un peuple affaibli et dÃƒÂ©muni socialement 
un peuple sans defense et sans armes par rapport ÃƒÂ  toute l'arsenal utilisÃƒÂ© par les amÃƒÂ©ricains et les britanniques..." - The war wasn't against the civilians, it was against the Hussein Regime, which by the way, was certainly not without defence. They had hundreds of ballistic missiles capable of reaching any country in the Middle East. Their army was being rebuilt after the desasterous war against Iran, which the Americans helped to fund. (Well, actually the Americans funded both sides of that war, but that's another story)...
    Iraq was not a peaceful country before the Gulf War, it was not a peaceful country after the Gulf War. We can only hope that once the Americans withdraw from Iraq that then, and only then, will it be peaceful.
