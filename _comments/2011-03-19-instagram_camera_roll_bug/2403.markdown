Please help I have an Instagram issue that's driving me crazy!

When I go on Instagram to create a new photo, I only see five or so of my recent photo library photos. None of the others come up.

Has anyone else experienced this? I have tried a soft reset, deleting and re downloading the app, nothing is working!

Thank you
