As embarrassing as it is to say this amongst die-hard mac fans, I'm one of those obnoxious Switchers. After spending a year on a Mac under OS 9.2 in college (doing Multimedia Design), I went out and bought a Mac running 10.2



The only thing I even turn the PC on for anymore is browser testing. I couldn't go back if you paid me. Yes, my 800MHz eMac *isn't* as "snappy" as my 1.5GHz PC.. but for me it's all about the user experience; it's built from the ground up with the end user in mind and it really shows. I love it.
