Advertising can be switched off in: Membership area > Pro/Plus Tab Preferences, but this seems to generate a cosmetic bug where the Product info overlaps the table on the right.

I'm also experiencing a problem where all items are "Not yet rated"!!

At last, It would be nice if VersionTracker offered the possibility to view a screenshot like in MacUpdate (<a href="http://www.macupdate.com/screenshot.php?id=5661)." rel="nofollow">http://www.macupdate.com/screenshot.php?id=5661).</a>
