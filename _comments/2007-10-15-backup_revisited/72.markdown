@Adriano: did you quite all running apps? If so, you probably have a service accessing the drive (filesharing most probably).

Here are the steps I follow on my Mac OS X Server:

1. Open server Admin;
2. Stop file sharing services (AFP, Windows);
3. Open SoftRAID;
4. Split MIrror Volume Backup into â€œRead-only Secondary Diskâ€?. Two disks with the same name will appear in the Finder. One has a padlock, that is the secondary drive;
5. Unmount the padlocked volume and remove physically the disk from the system;
6. Insert the other secondary disk. It will appear as locked volume in SoftRAID;
8. Click it and select "Convert Read-only Secondary Drive" from the Volume menu;
9. A dialog box will ask you what to do with it. Select â€œAdd to original mirrorâ€?. The secondary disk will then synched;
10. Restart file sharing services and resume normal life.

If you're not running Mac OS Server, turn the file sharing services off from the System Preferences > Sharing pane.
