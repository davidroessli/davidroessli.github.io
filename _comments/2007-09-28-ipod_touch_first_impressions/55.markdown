You can use iTunes to verify that all the music, videos, and other items you bought from the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store are in your iTunes library. You might want to do this if a download was interrupted. Here's how:

1. In iTunes, choose Store > Check for Purchases.
2. Enter your iTunes Store account ID and password, then click Check.
3. Purchases not yet on your computer will be downloaded.
