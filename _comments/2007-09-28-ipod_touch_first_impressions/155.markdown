@Jose I agree. Actually, with all the problems the iPhone 3G is plagued with, it's a better alternative. Both in terms of battery life and overall stability.

If you are happy with your current cellphone, and don't have sync issues, stick with it and buy an iPod Touch.
(who's price might significatively drop this month if you believe the rumours).

Not to mention, the iPhone probably is the worse cameraphone I have ever seen.
