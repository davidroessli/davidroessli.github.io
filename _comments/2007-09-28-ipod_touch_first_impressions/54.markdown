No. Unfortunately, not yet. The firmware upgrade didn't change anything. I suspect the problem lies somehow on the server side.

I 've just received the invoices relative to my purchases on the WiFi Store: <strong>in German</strong> (sigh). I contacted client support and see what they'll come back with.
