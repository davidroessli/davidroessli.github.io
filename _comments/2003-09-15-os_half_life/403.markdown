Perhaps you almost just ran out of memory, including harddisk storage at some time. That is the only time when I loose settings and the system is acting up like you describe. I have a G3 server running for a 120 days or thereabouts, and after I tried to install SETI at home, it wrote an endless amount of cr.. in the system log. I almost had to reboot, but caught it at less than a megabyte free on the harddisk. Oh, well, the ssh-key broke, but that's life ;-)
