Dave,

I found this on Adobe's website:

http://helpx.adobe.com/mena/using/arabic-hebrew.html#id_39921

<b>Legacy font support</b>
Available in InDesign CS6, Illustrator CS6, Photoshop CS6

Fonts that have been traditionally used (for example, AXT fonts) can continue to be used in this release of the software. However, it is recommended that newer Open Type fonts be used for text-based elements.

Missing Glyph Protection (Edit > Preferences > Advanced Type) is enabled by default. Text is handled automatically, where glyphs are not available in the font you are using.
