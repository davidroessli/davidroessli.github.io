The inability of AppleWorks to do a mail merge with the Address Book in X 10.2 is a major downfall. Until Apple comes up with a fix in an updated AppleWorks, I'm using AppleScript.



I've created a simple script to get names and addresses from a group in Address Book and copy them to an AppleWorks database. From this database you can use the usual mail merge funtion.



It's a bit of a kluge solution but it works and still allows you to use Address Book as your contacts database.



You can download the example script from my idisk:

Finder->Go->Connect to Server: <a href="http://idisk.mac.com/haroldshields/Public" rel="nofollow">http://idisk.mac.com/haroldshields/Public</a>

The example uses a Xmas Card Recipients group. You can change the name of the group in the script to suit your purposes.



Cheers!
