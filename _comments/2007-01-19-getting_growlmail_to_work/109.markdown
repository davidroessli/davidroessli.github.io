A nice way to change your plist files is with <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/prefsetter.html" rel="nofollow">Pref Setter</a>.
Then you can see what your actually changing and easily re-change it you want.

However, I did this

defaults write com.apple.mail EnableBundles 1
defaults write com.apple.mail BundleCompatibilityVersion 2

and my Growlmail still dosn't work. Its not in the System Prefs > Growl > Application, but it does show up in the mail application. No notification, though. Any other ideas? Thanks!
