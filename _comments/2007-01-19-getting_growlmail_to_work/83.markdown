This didn't work for me.  Whatever I did in Terminal did SOMETHING because the next time I opened Mail it told me that the GrowlMail app was incompatible and it would be deactivated... the same msg I got the first time I booted up Leopard.

This is on a brand new Mac with a Clean Leopard Install.

Any other suggestions?  I miss my Growl notifications.
