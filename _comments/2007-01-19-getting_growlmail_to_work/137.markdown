Just found this thread and downloaded Growl Beta 1.1.3 onto my G4 PowerBook running OS X 10.5.2 and Growlmail now works perfectly. Just installing on my iMac (Intel Core 2 Duo) with OS X 10.5.2 running and no apparent inconsistencies with Mail.

Will report back if things do not work to plan. Much obliged for the advice given here.
