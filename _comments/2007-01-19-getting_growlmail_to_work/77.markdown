@Elo: Mac OS X 10.5's Mail.app requires bundle version 3 or greater. You can try the following command to enable GrowlMail:

<pre>defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail EnableBundles -bool YES
defaults write com.apple.mail BundleCompatibilityVersion -int 3</pre>

Or, download the script from http://trac.growl.info/changeset/4693

There is an interesting AppleScript alternative that is described in a blog post called "<a href="http://blog.insidesystems.net/articles/2007/08/17/growl-mail-app-and-applescript" rel="nofollow">Growl, Mail.app and AppleScript</a>" by Kevin Way.
