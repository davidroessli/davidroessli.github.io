@firebirdc5: are you running the latest version? Check for other Mail add-ons, font managers, or haxies you may have installed and deactivate them temporarily. Other users are having similar problems. Check this thread http://tinyurl.com/2c5x4q (you could try to downgrade to the previous version 0.76)

@smanny: you need to open the Terminal application which is located in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder and type in the two commands.
