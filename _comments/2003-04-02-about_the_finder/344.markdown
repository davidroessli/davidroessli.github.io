thanks. 

took look. looks interesting. 

when possible will look closer.



I was re-reading the Siracusa article. I had forgotten all the little osx annoyances I still experience but have taught myself to ignore. I always work in collumns mode because of the ease of cascading through the directories and lack of clutter. But then when opening up a directory higher up the chain i go and loose the one i'm currently looking at. Gets to me every time.
