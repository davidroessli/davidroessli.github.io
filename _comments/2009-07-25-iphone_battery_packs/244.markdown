Hi,
I have an iPhone 3GS and am considering buying an external battery pack for it.  From what I've read above it appears that the Mophie Juice Pack Air is about 2 ounces, while the Mophie Juice Pack is about 3 ounces, and the FastMac IV is about 4 ounces.  I don't own any of these prodcts, yet, but don't feel that the weight factor is significant for me.  I wish Apple built the iPhone with a faster CPU and more RAM and the ability to handle media on the Adobe Flash Player, thus justifying the need for more "horsepower under the hood." 
I am concerned about safety of my 32GB device and compatibility of any of these three batteries with a car mount.
