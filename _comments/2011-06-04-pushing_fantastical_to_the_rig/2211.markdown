A little help!

First, thanks for this. After downloading Fantastical, my first move was to try and push it right.

However, I downloaded the little menu extra, opened it, and got things moved right.

Then on restart, it comes right back left. Command+move doesn't work to pull it right again.

I did delete the little menu extra. Should I have opened package contents and put it in there? Put it in the applications folder? I don't have to keep it in my downloads folder permanently, do I?

Thanks for the help!
