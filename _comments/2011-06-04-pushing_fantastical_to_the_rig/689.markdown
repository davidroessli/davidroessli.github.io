Dear Sirs,

I share the point of view of the writer: IMHO calendar menu should be close to the clock a to the right-most end of the menu bar.

I tried what you suggest (: double-click, hold command key, click-n-drag) but this doesn't work: opens and closes the view, then command-click-n-hold opens once more the calendar but the menubar icon is not moving.

Am I missing something?

I'm using 1.0.3 release; in the lower right side corner of the "About Fantastical" window I can read a small "58".

Many thanks in advance for any advice you will share.

Best regards,

    -- lS.
