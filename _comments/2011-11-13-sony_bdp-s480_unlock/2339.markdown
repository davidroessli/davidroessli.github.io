I used this on my s720 and confirm it works. It took a while to get there. I used an One for All URC-7140. Other models might have similar issues.

When I press 994 the blue light blinks. a couple of times. Yiu need to wait for it to stop blinking before  pressing the magic key again (between steps 5 and 6, etc.)

I'm hoping I don't face the same issues as Martin (post #26). Only hacked it today, but I'll let you know if the machine dies on me.
