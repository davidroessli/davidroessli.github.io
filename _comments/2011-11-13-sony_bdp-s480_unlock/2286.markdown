Hi,

it worked for me on a BDP-S1100 Model with the code "20533" used in the first step....or one of the other "..533" codes, I don't know for sure, read on...

There was NO flashing of anything as described in the last step where you send the commands to the player. Neither on the remote (other than the one-time flashing that happens with every press of any button) nor on the player. However, it must have worked because I can play my region 1 DVDs now.

Unfortunately I missed the opportunity to try and see if the DVD would have played with the player in its out of the box state. I do not know if what I did made it work, or if it perhaps would have worked anyways. I also cannot say if the "0533" or "00533" code already did the trick in my first two attempts because there was never any feedback (flashing) if the commands I sent were successfully received or not. I also did not try to play the DVD inbetween the attempts of the different initiall "533 codes". I simply tried them one after another and was hoping to see the confirming flashing, wich did never happen. So after 3 attempts I simply put in the DVD and it played.

Therefore I cannot say which initial code finally made it work.

I used the One For All URC 3940 Slim Line 4 remote.
