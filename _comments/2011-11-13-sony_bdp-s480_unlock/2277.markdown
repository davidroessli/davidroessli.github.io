Hi,

Thanks for this post.

- Does this trick work for REGION 1 (American) Sony Blu-Ray players? 
Anybody has tested on Region 1 Sony players?

I read it works only for Region 2 and 4 Blu-Ray players, so I'm not sure to order a One For All remote control to free my unit which is Region 1 (from USA)...

- Does this procedure works for Sony BDP-S1100 ?

Thanks a lot
