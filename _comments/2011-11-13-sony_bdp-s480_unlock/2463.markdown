I purchased a Sony S5200 Blu-Ray player in USA and a RCA URC  RCR003RWD. I followed the instructions which came with the URC to program it for controlling my Blu-Ray player. The On-Off and several other keys are now working. However, the procedure to make the player region free did not yield any result. Any guidance will be most welcome and appreciated.
