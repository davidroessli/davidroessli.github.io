I've tested the 0533 method on the Sony BDP S1500 (Region 1 US player) and confirmed the remote hack does not work (at least with the following numbers) tested 0533, 1516, 2555, 2043, and 1070 also  tried out 
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 for final step.  Placed my region 2 DVD  discs and region B Blu-ray Discs. No  response.  Unless I missed something or there is another code the region one US players are non responsive to this hack.
