I have a BPD-BX2 and using the oneforall remote procedure (URC 7740) I have a couple questions:

After inputting the 0533 I jumped right into the other steps and everything blinked on each step. My blu ray was on the whole time I did the code with the words Home showing on the display screen. I hit 12345 and the player started flashing blue. It says to put back in stand by. I have no idea what stand by is so I turned it off and back on. It didn't work.

Can you clarify what stand by mode is?

When you hit 12345 is the blue flasing light what I'm looking for?
