@Johnny K yes, I had exactly the same issue until I used the <b>0533</b> code.

I know this is a bit cumbersome, but try using the other setup codes such as 20533 or 1516.

What is your  model? The above procedure worked for my <b>Blu-Ray player</b>, I'm not sure it works for DVD players (as you mention in your comment).
