Above does not work for me....
programmed my all in one, which seemed to go just as outlined until the " 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 " step. that only turns the DVD player off...
no blue 24p light appears...
0533 alternative only turns off the DVD player...

seems pressing 5 is a turn-off so to speak....

I am still not region free.....
