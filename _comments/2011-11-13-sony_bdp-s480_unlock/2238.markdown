Works great with a AFO URC-7140 as well.

URC-7140 source-led doesn't just blink twice in the beginning but stays on until you finish each set and blinks twice at the end.

Made my Swedish DBP-S383 region free using this guide. You also don't need the original remote to switch the unit on and off for it to work.(I used the powerbutton on the player)
