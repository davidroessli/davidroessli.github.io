Thanks for this.
I can confirm that the hack above works for a Sony BDP-S490 with a One For All URC-4170 remote.
I have tried Region 1, 2 and 3 DVDs and now thankfully it will play them all! 
I disconnected the player from the mains and then plugged it in again just to check if it would lock again but it seems it is still region free.
Now I will put in the correct code 1516 to enable the URC to control the player.
Cheers!
