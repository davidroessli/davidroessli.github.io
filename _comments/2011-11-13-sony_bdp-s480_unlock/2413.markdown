Success with a Sony BDP-S590 (region 2) and an All-In-One URC-7960 by following the instructions above! 
To those people with region-1 players (USA/Canada etc.) I've heard that this method can't be used to make it region free though I can't personally confirm this. Has someone with a region-1 Sony Blu-Ray player managed to make theirs region-free?


To Marc:
I agree it's confusing as I didn't understand it at first either, but I figured out that the first stage (the instructions with the magic codes above etc.) is all about programming the All-In-One. The next stage is actually transmitting those codes over to the Sony Blu-Ray player to make it region-free, so this is what you do after having programmed the All-In-One:

1) (Using the Sony remote) turn the Sony Blu-Ray player ON (if it's not already on)

2) ensure that there is no disc inside

3) Wait till the Blu-Ray player is ready (its display should read "Home")

4) (Using the One-For-All remote), press the following number buttons after each other: 1 2 3 4 5  

5) If I remember correctly there should now be an "OK" in the Blu-Ray player's display

6) (using the Sony remote) turn OFF the Blu-Ray player

4) turn ON the Blu-Ray player, insert a different region DVD and enjoy your success!

Hope this helps and good luck!
