Use the Sony remote to bring the player out of standby, make sure there isn't a disc in it;
Press 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on the OneForAll remote. The light will start flashing;
Put the player back into standby with the Sony remote.
Next time you turn on the player it will be region free for DVD playback.

I don't understand this procedure.
Turn on Blu ray player
then on 1forAll press 1 2 3 4 5??
Do I have to press first the magic button?
If I use 12345 nothing happen on the 1forAll remote.
If I press the magic button only 1234 are accepted.

Please explain better
I have a model DBP-S3200
