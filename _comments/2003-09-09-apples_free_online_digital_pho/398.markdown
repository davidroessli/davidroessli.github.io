i wish apple would do a more professional job at this.  I signed up for the "seminar."  It's mostly a glorified infomercial.  It's filmed with a desk and ugly blue desktop and two hosts, one of whom continually says "uh" and looks away from the camera to read his notes.  So far, 18 minutes into the video, the only thing I've "learned" is that going digital will pay for itself in a couple of months, and I can use all the same lenses I've used in the past on the new high end digital camera I purchased.  Oh, and Mac is easy.  Yeah, great.  How about some actual instruction?
